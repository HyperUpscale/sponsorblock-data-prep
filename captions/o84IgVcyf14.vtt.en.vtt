00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.420
{♫Intro♫}

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.501
This video was filmed on March 3 2020.

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:11.001
If we have a more up-to-date version of it,

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.040
it will be linked at the top of the description,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.820
and right up there.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.541
Let’s go over some terminology to start.

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:22.330
SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, specifically it is

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.195
a new kind of Coronavirus

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.848
that appeared suddenly in late 2019

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:28.970
in the city of Wuhan, China.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.470
Coronaviruses are common,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.970
you have likely had a coronavirus lots of times,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.900
it’s one kind of virus that causes

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.019
the common cold.

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.501
But they can also cause SARS and MERS,

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:41.570
two diseases that have very high case mortality

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.070
rates.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.102
They’re very dangerous,

00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:47.514
and the disease that SARS-CoV-2 causes

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.579
has been named COVID-19

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.309
short for coronavirus disease 2019.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.738
This disease spread very quickly in China
at first,

00:00:56.738 --> 00:00:58.889
but new cases there are slowing,

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.163
and now the majority of new cases are

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:02.041
outside China.

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.360
This raises the question...do we have

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.960
a pandemic on our hands?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.323
And the answer, yes, maybe,

00:01:08.323 --> 00:01:12.063
also no, and also it doesn’t really matter

00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:13.103
and it actually

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.428
matters a lot.

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:17.000
So...that’s why this video is here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.560
First of all, “Pandemic” sounds like an official term,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.840
but there aren’t super hard rules

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.969
or numbers for when it can or should be used.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.146
In general, we use the term epidemic

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:28.646
to describe a sudden, unexpected increase in cases

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:33.250
of a disease in a particular region.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.137
A pandemic, on the other hand,

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:37.575
is sudden, unexpected worldwide spread

00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:38.409
of a disease.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.864
Why does the difference between those things matter?

00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:42.469
Well, it’s not just whether we get

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.500
to use a scarier word in the headlines…

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.920
there’s also a difference in how we respond.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.553
Epidemics you contain.

00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:52.929
Pandemics you can only mitigate.

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.789
So, then how do we decide when something

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:56.719
is a pandemic?

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.424
Researchers have said they’d need to see

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:02.399
evidence of sustained, domestic transmission

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.899
in at least one more region outside of the
Pacific region that includes China, Japan,

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.360
and South Korea before using the term “pandemic”.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.017
So the question is whether these cases outside

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:13.517
the Pacific are spreading on their own.

00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:18.470
Not just new arrivals, but new spread.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.166
And while we didn’t see any evidence of
that in the early months

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:23.610
of the COVID-19 outbreak,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.795
we now have seen cases that aren’t directly
linked

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:29.280
to either travel, or exposure to people

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.300
who’ve traveled.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.294
Instead, it looks like it might be

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:34.230
what’s known as community spread.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.119
Community spread, or community cases,

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.570
are essentially when the source of the infection

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.570
is unknown.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.396
In this case, that would mean people who

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:42.374
haven’t been to China

00:02:42.374 --> 00:02:43.780
and also have’t been in direct contact with someone

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.039
who was recently in China are getting sick.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.020
It’s spreading from person to person

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.777
in their own community

00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:56.170
via droplets from coughing or sneezing or just, talking loudly.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.622
As of February 29th, three states in the US

00:02:58.622 --> 00:03:00.890
have reported community-acquired cases:

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.250
California, Oregon, and Washington.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.820
And a preliminary genetic analysis of the
virus,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.640
sampled from two separate patients in Washington state,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.830
suggests that the virus was quietly spreading there for a while.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.506
The virus in the two patients

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:17.090
had a particular genetic signature that only

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.830
a small fraction of samples from China had.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.207
If the two cases were both new introductions

00:03:22.207 --> 00:03:24.530
from abroad, it would be unlikely that they

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.160
both had that signature.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.211
That suggests that there has been sustained transmission

00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:30.900
in Washington state for several weeks --

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.311
though we’d need to find the sick people

00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.480
who did that transmission to confirm this.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.204
It seems likely that there are more cases

00:03:38.204 --> 00:03:38.704
than outbreak responders are aware of,

00:03:38.704 --> 00:03:40.180
probably because those people

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.680
simply aren’t sick enough to go to the doctor.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.830
So does this make this a pandemic?

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.225
Again, there’s not a hard and fast rule,

00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:52.040
but remember we’d need to see not just

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.910
domestic transmission, but sustained transmission.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.988
So is that happening?

00:03:55.988 --> 00:03:58.176
Well, many experts and scientists say yes,

00:03:58.176 --> 00:03:59.540
but, as of this recording, the WHO (World Health Organization)

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.961
has chosen not to use the word pandemic.

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:06.646
And it so happens that the WHO

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:07.146
is having meetings between when we’re filming this

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:10.960
and when you’re seeing it.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.739
They’re the ones who get to say,

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.630
although even if they say it, it’s not a formal term

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.549
-- just their assessment of things.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.619
The formal use of the word “pandemic”

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:22.430
was actually retired in 2009!

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.980
If they decide at those meetings

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.480
that they’ve seen what they’re looking for,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.500
they may switch from their current policy

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.776
of trying to contain the disease,

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:32.060
to naming it a pandemic and switching to a strategy

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.030
of mitigating the effects.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.136
They’re looking for sustained, community-acquired transmission –

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:40.740
that is, many, many cases where no one knows

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.590
how someone got sick.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.552
Now this might seem like splitting hairs,

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:46.052
but there are reasons why they might be

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.620
shy about making this call.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.870
No one responds to news like “there’s a pandemic” lightly,

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.870
and they get that.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.704
As for why we ended up in this situation in
the first place,

00:04:57.704 --> 00:04:58.980
we do have some ideas about why COVID-19 has been able to spread.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.690
As we mentioned, it’s spread from person to person

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.610
in droplets when a sick person coughs or sneezes.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.139
It’s also been suggested that a number of
cases

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.140
are being spread by folks without any symptoms at all.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.960
That’s called asymptomatic transmission.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.059
But on Tuesday, the WHO said that,

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:19.191
at least in China,

00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:21.330
only one percent of reported cases

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.450
had no symptoms -

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.680
and most of those developed symptoms within days.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.783
So it looks like asymptomatic transmission
is really rare,

00:05:28.783 --> 00:05:30.120
and that’s unlikely to be

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.060
the main driver of new cases, which is very
good news.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.354
Pandemic or no pandemic,

00:05:35.354 --> 00:05:35.854
it’s important to remember that this designation

00:05:35.854 --> 00:05:41.570
has nothing to do with how deadly a disease is.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.473
The term only describes where the disease
is spreading.

00:05:45.473 --> 00:05:48.460
It doesn’t tell you anything else.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.050
And we’re not really sure what the mortality
rate of COVID-19 is.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.382
It’s changing so fast it’s hard to even
pick a number to cite.

00:05:56.382 --> 00:05:57.720
For one thing, it’s been different so far in China

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.973
than in the rest of the world,

00:05:59.973 --> 00:06:02.000
and different in some parts of China than

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.730
in other parts of China.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.648
For another, the actual rate might be much lower,

00:06:06.648 --> 00:06:09.970
since mild cases may very well be going unrecognized.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.373
You may have heard a figure around two percent

00:06:12.373 --> 00:06:14.410
cited in the news, and that’s backed up

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.297
by the published literature so far,

00:06:16.297 --> 00:06:16.797
but it’s probably not going to be the number

00:06:16.797 --> 00:06:19.100
we have when the dust settles.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.100
And the number’s gonna be very different in places

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.834
with more robust healthcare systems

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:26.360
than in places that don’t have lots of respirators.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.824
We’re planning a whole other episode for you

00:06:28.824 --> 00:06:30.661
on how we understand and compare

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:32.950
fatality rates, so keep an eye out for that.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.070
In the end, whether something’s an epidemic

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.200
or pandemic may have as much to do with

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.890
our response to the disease as the disease itself.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.269
If it’s an epidemic, the nation or region
where it’s happening

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.980
may try to contain it and prevent it from getting out.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.200
But with a pandemic, the focus may be

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.856
more on mitigation efforts,

00:06:49.856 --> 00:06:50.960
like surveillance, treatment, and protecting

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.139
vulnerable populations.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:54.407
They may also focus on

00:06:54.407 --> 00:06:56.340
slowing the spread of the disease

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.980
through what’s called social distancing:

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.284
things like dismissing school

00:07:00.284 --> 00:07:02.725
or postponing mass gatherings,

00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:05.800
rather than just trying to keep it out of the community.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.887
And there are also things we as individuals
can do

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.480
to help prevent the spread of the disease.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.486
People should be aware of the symptoms of this disease,

00:07:14.486 --> 00:07:17.180
which include fever, dry cough, and tiredness.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.114
Those are the main COVID specific things

00:07:19.114 --> 00:07:19.955
to watch out for.

00:07:19.955 --> 00:07:21.300
People might also get aches and pains,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.800
a sore throat,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.153
a runny or congested nose…

00:07:24.153 --> 00:07:27.230
and I realize now I’m just listing

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.220
symptoms of a cold or flu!

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.529
That's why it's really important

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.860
to contact your doctor if you start having any

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.050
difficulty breathing --

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.170
which is more indicative of this disease.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.937
And when I say contact a doctor,

00:07:37.937 --> 00:07:40.919
I mean call them, don’t go in to sit in a waiting room

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.520
with a bunch of strangers.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.293
The US Centers for Disease Control

00:07:44.293 --> 00:07:46.366
recommends avoiding touching your face,

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:49.189
avoiding close contact with people who are sick,

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.689
and staying home if you yourself are sick.

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:51.660
You should also wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.740
That’s not just some empty platitude.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.675
Coronaviruses are surrounded

00:07:58.675 --> 00:08:02.030
by an envelope of oily material.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.790
And soap is really, really good at disrupting
and dissolving oily stuff.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.505
So washing your hands with soap and water

00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:10.220
for 20 seconds -- about the time it takes

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.207
to sing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,

00:08:12.207 --> 00:08:14.079
or the chorus from Toto’s “Africa,”

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:17.333
whichever you prefer -- is a genuinely effective way

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.210
of destroying virus particles.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.210
And you should also get your flu shot. We
mean this. Now, the flu shot isn’t gonna

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:29.280
protect you from COVID-19, but the flu and
COVID-19 have similar symptoms. Which means

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.059
one could be confused for the other, placing
an extra burden of testing and treatment on

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.059
health providers.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:39.740
Plus, you’re less likely to get the flu,
and the flu sucks. Also if you do get it,

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.569
it’ll probably be less severe, meaning you’re
less likely to need treatment from a potentially

00:08:45.569 --> 00:08:47.319
overworked healthcare system.

00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:51.120
They also want people to stop buying face
masks. Surgical masks are good at keeping

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.750
your stuff in, not necessarily the world out.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.240
So unless you’re a healthcare worker or
already sick, or you are in a specific situation

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.560
where your doctor has recommended a mask,
they won’t do much.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.769
And we should leave them for the people who
need them.

00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:09.949
In sum, it’s understandable that the word
“pandemic” is being thrown around, whether

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:15.869
COVID-19 is one by definition or assignation
by the WHO or not.

00:09:15.869 --> 00:09:21.230
It’s okay to be concerned. After all, events
like this are uncertain, and we can give you

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.790
some facts here on SciShow, but we can’t
eliminate that uncertainty.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.980
There are many people who’ve been affected,
families who’ve lost loved ones and we should

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.980
keep them in our hearts.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.639
But when you see the whole story from a thousand
feet up, it’s relatively mild compared to

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:36.050
what we’d feared.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.520
There are clear things we can all do to reduce
the risk of transmission, both for our own

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.139
benefit and for those around us;

00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:47.329
And there are a lot of smart people working
really hard to make this better.

00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:49.430
Outro:
Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.879
News. We really hope it’s helped you understand
a complex and rapidly changing situation.

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:59.222
And it’s been brought to you in part by
Brilliant.org. They want to help us all get

00:09:59.222 --> 00:10:03.890
smarter day by day -- and for that, they have
their daily challenges.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.929
From statistics to electricity to computer
science, these questions will give you a new

00:10:07.929 --> 00:10:13.139
way to challenge yourself every day, and learn
how we understand the world around us.

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:17.829
Each problem comes with illustrations, animations,
or interactive visualizations, and all the

00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:20.680
context you need to solve the problem yourself.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.279
What’s more, you can access each day’s
challenges for free -- though Premium members

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:27.140
get access to the full archive.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:34.079
And the first 200 people to sign up at Brilliant.org/SciShow
will get 20% off an annual Premium subscription.

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:38.660
Just remember -- by checking them out, you’re
helping support us so we can make videos like

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.660
this. So thanks.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:49.080
