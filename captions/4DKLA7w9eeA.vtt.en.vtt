yeah<00:04:04.319><c> that's</c><00:04:04.640><c> fast</c><00:04:04.879><c> because</c><00:04:05.200><c> there's</c><00:04:05.439><c> often</c>

yeah that's fast because there's often

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%

i really think that counting is kind of

i really think that counting is kind of

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
to drag it it was all immediate it
 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.629 align:start position:0%
to drag it it was all immediate it
seemed<00:05:02.160><c> like</c><00:05:02.560><c> there</c><00:05:02.800><c> was</c><00:05:03.520><c> a</c><00:05:03.680><c> bit</c><00:05:03.840><c> of</c><00:05:04.000><c> a</c><00:05:04.240><c> delay</c>

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%

yeah i'm not going to be able to tell

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
counting was actually pretty consistent
 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:19.990 align:start position:0%
counting was actually pretty consistent
but<00:05:18.639><c> you</c><00:05:18.720><c> won't</c><00:05:18.960><c> know</c><00:05:19.199><c> if</c><00:05:19.280><c> your</c><00:05:19.440><c> counting</c><00:05:19.759><c> was</c>

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
but you won't know if your counting was
 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.990 align:start position:0%
but you won't know if your counting was
consistent<00:05:20.960><c> no</c><00:05:21.199><c> i'm</c><00:05:21.360><c> just</c><00:05:21.520><c> going</c><00:05:21.600><c> to</c><00:05:21.680><c> assume</c>

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
consistent no i'm just going to assume
 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.670 align:start position:0%
consistent no i'm just going to assume
and<00:05:22.160><c> then</c><00:05:22.639><c> i'm</c><00:05:22.800><c> going</c><00:05:22.880><c> to</c><00:05:22.960><c> make</c><00:05:23.120><c> my</c><00:05:23.280><c> guesses</c>

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
and then i'm going to make my guesses
 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.909 align:start position:0%
and then i'm going to make my guesses
based<00:05:24.080><c> on</c><00:05:24.240><c> that</c><00:05:24.560><c> counting</c><00:05:25.440><c> and</c><00:05:25.520><c> then</c><00:05:25.759><c> i'll</c>

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
based on that counting and then i'll
 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.270 align:start position:0%
based on that counting and then i'll
know<00:05:26.160><c> whether</c><00:05:26.400><c> or</c><00:05:26.479><c> not</c><00:05:26.639><c> it</c><00:05:26.720><c> was</c><00:05:26.880><c> consistent</c>

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
know whether or not it was consistent
 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.029 align:start position:0%
know whether or not it was consistent
based<00:05:27.520><c> on</c><00:05:27.600><c> the</c><00:05:28.080><c> results</c><00:05:28.479><c> and</c><00:05:28.560><c> whether</c><00:05:28.800><c> or</c><00:05:28.880><c> not</c>

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
based on the results and whether or not
 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.469 align:start position:0%
based on the results and whether or not
i<00:05:29.199><c> was</c><00:05:29.280><c> correct</c><00:05:29.680><c> right</c>

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
i was correct right
 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.469 align:start position:0%
i was correct right
okay<00:05:30.960><c> yeah</c><00:05:31.520><c> i</c><00:05:31.680><c> actually</c><00:05:31.919><c> don't</c><00:05:32.080><c> find</c><00:05:32.320><c> this</c>

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i actually don't find this
 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:33.990 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i actually don't find this
that<00:05:32.639><c> much</c><00:05:32.800><c> worse</c><00:05:33.120><c> it</c><00:05:33.199><c> felt</c><00:05:33.360><c> like</c><00:05:33.680><c> it</c><00:05:33.759><c> took</c><00:05:33.919><c> a</c>

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
that much worse it felt like it took a
 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.150 align:start position:0%
that much worse it felt like it took a

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.230 align:start position:0%
absolutely come on that's the question
we're<00:05:42.479><c> asking</c><00:05:43.199><c> system</c><00:05:43.520><c> two</c><00:05:43.759><c> is</c><00:05:43.919><c> definitely</c>

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're asking system two is definitely
 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.790 align:start position:0%
we're asking system two is definitely
overall<00:05:44.800><c> slower</c><00:05:45.520><c> uh</c><00:05:46.000><c> i</c><00:05:46.160><c> was</c><00:05:46.320><c> surprised</c><00:05:46.720><c> to</c>

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
overall slower uh i was surprised to
 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.550 align:start position:0%
overall slower uh i was surprised to
find<00:05:46.960><c> that</c><00:05:47.120><c> in</c><00:05:47.360><c> every</c><00:05:47.680><c> game</c><00:05:47.919><c> across</c><00:05:48.240><c> the</c><00:05:48.320><c> board</c>

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
find that in every game across the board
 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.469 align:start position:0%
find that in every game across the board
it<00:05:48.639><c> took</c><00:05:48.880><c> just</c><00:05:49.280><c> another</c><00:05:49.680><c> second</c><00:05:50.000><c> another</c><00:05:50.320><c> two</c>

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
it took just another second another two
 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.550 align:start position:0%
it took just another second another two
