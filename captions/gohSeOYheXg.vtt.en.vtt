00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.140
Me? Cycle in London? No! I'll die.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.800
You've got to be stark raving mad to cycle in London.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.300
I would cycle, but there are too many roads.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.000
I tried cycling once, but there was a bus on the other side of the road. Aargh!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.840
What's wrong with these people? Cycling is good exercise, it's free, it's fun

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.060
You can change your route as you please, you can park anywhere, it's usually faster than the bus,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.060
sometimes faster than the Tube, and yet for some reason, cyclists in London are still

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.100
a rare and strange breed.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.500
So, why isn't cycling normal in London? Is it to do with the way the streets were built?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.860
Or is it something embedded in our culture?

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.320
Or is it a complicated and nuanced mixture of the two combined with several other surprisingly interesting

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.700
factors that will take about ten minutes to discuss?

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.320
♫ ♫ ♫

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.180
Cycling infrastructure in London has been around longer than you might think.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.780
As far back as the 1930s when hardly anyone drove, the wise town planners decreed that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.820
cars and bikes don't mix.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.220
New suburbs in Morden, Perivale and Romford were furnished with shiny, wide, segregated,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.720
cycle tracks. The first of its kind was opened by transport minister Leslie Hore-Belisha in 1934.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.340
But they weren't really used much.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.720
Cycling groups at the time hated these so-called cycle tracks.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.520
They were worried that they'd be forced to use them and then banned from regular roads.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.520
Indeed, that's exactly what Leslie Hore-Belisha wanted, saying that cyclists were

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.680
"the most dangerous people on the road today."

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.980
So a cycling revolution never came. But a new revolution was just around the corner.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.060
Introducing the new Car.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.440
Think you can't afford a car? Thanks to technology, the new car is more affordable than ever.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.920
You can afford the new car.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.540
With the new car, you can drive around in your new car.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.260
- Do you like your new car?
- I love my new car. (giggles)

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.940
(continues giggling)

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.400
As cars became more affordable, the roads became more full of them. And so, the 1960s planners

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.380
in their finite wisdom, altered London's existing streets to make more room for cars.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.800
and cyclists were completely forgotten about.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.620
Historic Hyde Park Corner was turned into a massive scary roundabout where every lane is the wrong lane.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.300
So was Archway, Elephant and Castle, Waterloo and Hammersmith.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.320
(car horns)

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.440
The Westway was built. Bleurgh! And nearly all the 1930s suburban cycle tracks disappeared.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.240
Some becoming lanes for cars, others becoming parking spaces.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.580
Unsurprisingly, over the next few decades, the number of cyclists in London plummeted.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.880
* crash
- Oww!!

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.520
This terrifying video from about 1984½ which, believe it or not, is trying to promote cycling in London

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.720
shows just how treacherous and horrible life on two wheels had become.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.720
it was Cars 1, Cyclists dead.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.720
Meanwhile, in Europe...

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.780
Cities like Amsterdam which in the 70s had similarly lethal roads to London,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.800
not to mention a few dead children, decided to do something brave.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.020
Over the next three decades, the historic streets were totally transformed to prioritise pedestrians &amp; pedallers.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.300
Cars were banned from some streets, and new segregated, wide, uninterrupted, smooth cycle paths

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.200
were built in the lanes where people used to drive.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.920
Turning Amsterdam inside out wasn't easy and it didn't happen overnight, but eventually cycling became

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.080
the normal, default way of getting around. And it was cars that had to learn to wait their turn,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.500
keep out of the way, and go the long way round.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.680
Now that doesn't mean that the Dutch are bike-mad cycling enthusiasts. That's a bit like saying that

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.020
everyone in Britain is obsessed with vacuum cleaners just because everyone's got one.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.080
- In Holland
- The Netherlands!

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.720
...the Netherlands, there's no such thing as a cyclist.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.780
These people are teachers, doctors, lawyers, students,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.000
systems analysts, chartered quantity surveyors and porn stars.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.020
So why didn't this happen in London? Actually it's quite hard to say.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.700
Maybe it's because we Brits have always been overly attached to our cars.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.260
In the 80s, cars were a status symbol. Margaret Thatcher famously apparently probably said...

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.160
"A man over 30 who finds himself on a bus can count himself a failure."

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.480
This meant that politicians and planners who wanted to make cycling better always did so with their

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.740
hands tied behind their back. They couldn't do anything to get in the way of our lovely cars.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.340
Another possible reason is the way London was run for so many years.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.420
After Thatcher abolished the GLC in 1986,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.340
cycle infrastructure and the like was provided by London's 32 bickering boroughs.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.880
So there was no one to provide a city-wide shift in culture. But that would all change in the year 2000.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.780
For the first time London had an Assembly and a directly elected mayor

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.860
with the power and budget to think big.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.660
Ken Livingstone...
* ribbit

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.660
and the newly formed Transport for London, or TfL...

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.000
had to tackle London's chronic congestion and pesky pollution, &amp; they saw that cycling could play a vital role.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.080
Although late to the party, with the right investment, London had the potential to become

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.020
a cycling mecca just like Amsterdam. After all...

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.040
It's got the same climate, it's flat (mostly), the streets are wide enough, and most journeys in London

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.340
are a perfectly bikeable less than 2 miles.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.980
It was totally doable. They had to do it soon, and they had to do it now.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.520
Nearly more than 7 years later, Ken Livingstone stole an idea from Paris: The Cycle Hire Scheme.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.380
Docking stations were to be planted all over central London

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.060
with bikes that were too heavy and conspicuous to want to steal.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.360
And anyone with a bank card and a pair of legs could hire them for a small fee.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.060
It took until 2010 for the scheme to get going, by which time London had a new mayor whose idea it wasn't

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.040
giving the scheme the misleading but memorable and durable nickname "Boris Bikes".

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.300
They were an instant smash, popular with locals and wobbly tourists alike.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.940
They helped promote the idea that urban cycling wasn't just for lycra-clad enthusiasts, but for everybody.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.660
With so many new wibbly wobblies on the road, it was more important than ever that London had

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.940
safe streets to cycle on. And so, that very same year, along came the Mayor's most boldest plan so far:

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.720
The Cycle Superhighways.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.000
This was a new special type of bicycle motorway for commuters that was long distance, clearly labelled,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.080
and painted luminous bright blue to match the colour of Barclays who were sponsoring the whole thing.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.740
12 cycle superhighways were planned, numbered like hours on a clock radiating out from central London.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.180
The first to open in 2010 was CS7

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.020
which went over the underused Southwark Bridge, squiggled around Elephant and Castle

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.560
and followed the Northern line all the way down to Colliers Wood.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.480
Next came CS2 which went east from Aldgate, through Whitechapel, up to the future Olympic Park at Stratford.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.400
But were these superhighways any good? Er... no.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.520
- Although very...
- AAAARGH!!

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.340
AAARGH!! ... although very well signposted and a lovely shade of blue,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.140
there was nothing to physically separate cyclists from passing cars, buses and lorries.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.280
Sometimes the blue paint would stop abruptly, or merge with a bus lane or fill up with parked cars.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.740
Timid new cyclists, the very people this scheme was designed to make feel safe, didn't feel safe at all.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.720
More worryingly, newish and confidentish cyclists were lulled into a false sense of security.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.200
They'd start on an easy bit, and then when the blue paint ran out, splat.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.700
Venera Minachmetova, a 24 year old Russian businesswoman was killed by a lorry

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.280
at the notoriously inadequate Bow Interchange, one of 5 cyclists to die on the capital's streets in just 2 weeks.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.440
It led to protests calling for the Mayor and TfL to stop killing cyclists.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.540
A closer look at the original Superhighway designs reveals that they were dangerously ill-thought through.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.860
According to this map, CS11 was supposed to go up the very narrow Kilburn High Road.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.880
And where exactly was that meant to go?

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.320
So TfL went back to the drawing board and took it more seriously this time.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.320
The next generation of cycle superhighways from 2013 onwards was a massive improvement.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.800
Physically separated from traffic with features like dedicated traffic lights and floating bus stops,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.520
these were proper cycle paths, worthy of the Dutch.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.460
Have these new superhighways been a success? 
F*** yes!

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.240
Cycling on these routes has increased a whopping 60%. At rush hour 60% of all journeys are bikes.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.000
They even have cycling traffic jams. It demonstrates quite demonstrably that if you build it, they will come.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.560
Spurred on by the success of the cycle superhighways, the city was starting to send itself cycling silly. Look!

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.040
Torrington Place is closed to cars westbound.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.700
Look! Bank junction is buses and bikes only on weekdays.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.860
Look! Camden are filling their streets with armadillos. ARMADILLOS!

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.880
We're even starting to correct our mistakes from the 60s, turning former big scary roundabouts

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.780
into much safer, albeit confusing two-way, inside out, question mark shaped junctions.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:07.060
in Archway, Elephant and Castle, Waterloo, not Hammersmith though - it's too late for Hammersmith.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.960
So everybody's happy... or are they?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.580
The cycling revolution has attracted criticism from some groups like... (game show buzzer)

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.940
- Ooh, bad luck, and you're out of time.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:24.220
But you did very well. You did the history, you did the Superhighways, you even went to Amsterdam.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.620
But there's still so much more to talk about. Will you come back for part 2?

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.820
- Er, yes I will.
- Excellent! We look forward to it, don't we?

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.700
See you after the break!
