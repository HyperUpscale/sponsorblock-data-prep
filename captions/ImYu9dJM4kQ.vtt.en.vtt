This episode was sponsored by Skillshare

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.780
Human beings:

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.840
Are they as overpowered as the game's community would lead you to believe?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.120
Short answer: yeah.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.480
They're the most meta-defining build of all time.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.460
And the undisputed top build in the current expansion

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.820
But, believe it or not, this wasn't always the case.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.980
Humans used to get bodied left and right, on a daily basis by other players

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:34.255
And it took a pretty long time before the player base how to actually

00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:37.515
make use of the human build's unique abilities

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.380
The story of the humans rise to dominance is a really interesting one

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.600
And so today, we're gonna do an in-depth look

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.315
at the human's abilities, their strengths, and their weaknesses

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.180
Because yes, they do have weaknesses

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.635
We'll also go over notable matchups and finally look at the steps human players

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.615
took in order to reach their dominant status

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.200
First, their unique abilities

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.255
I touched on this topic in my video about primates, but I'll recap here

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.280
And also go into more detail

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.680
First off the bat, we have their ability to throw things.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.995
Other builds can throw things, but humans can do so harder,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.660
faster and further than anyone else

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.220
The reason for this is their body structure

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.320
Bipedal builds are tough to balance

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.640
Both within the game development sense and the center of mass sense.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.980
Throwing an item with any real force behind it requires serious balance

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.760
Achieved only by having shorter arms and longer legs

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.455
This is why humans can launch projectiles at deadly speeds

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:30.715
Whereas other primates kind of just lob things without putting much effort into it

00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:33.355
If they tried to, they would knock themselves over.

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:36.295
Even if chimpanzees could figure out how to craft a spear,

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:39.655
there's no way they could throw it hard enough to deal any significant damage

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.745
Next, there's stamina regeneration.

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:44.155
Humans can chase down anything

00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:47.825
If you try to run from a human, you might outspeed them initially,

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:50.455
But you'll run out of stamina much sooner than they will.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.905
And they'll catch you while you're in your weakened state.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.285
This is partially because of their superior balance again,

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:59.705
But mostly it's because of the human build's unique choice to not spec into fur

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:02.915
This gives them access to the extremely broken ability: sweat

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:06.195
Every other current build that's decent at distance running

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.760
recharges stamina by using the move "pant"

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.300
This works great, but it does require the user to stop running

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.920
Sweat, on the other hand, works better while moving

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.600
Massively extending the distance that human players can run

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.220
They've got a few other important abilities that are essential to their kit

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.920
But aren't unique to humans

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.120
Their ability to speak is unique among mammals, but some birds can pull it off too.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.880
In humans, the ability to speak allows them to use one of their signature moves:

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.200
teach, which drastically boosts skill point gain.

00:02:33.205 --> 00:02:36.535
Mitigating the main penalty a player receives upon getting a game over

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.900
Humans and birds also share another unique trait which is being able to stand upright.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.295
Standing upright is extremely useful for

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.780
dealing with stealth builds that might normally be using tall grass to hide

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.800
Tool use also might be thought of as a human-exclusive move,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.160
And it certainly is the most effective in humans

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.420
But it turns out, that a pretty wide array of other builds can also do it.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.525
Birds, primates, cephalopods and even fish can

00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:58.900
use tools on occasion

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.675
But sweating and throwing, uniquely human. Now onto their weaknesses.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.600
And yes, it's true that currently most human players can subvert these with their crafting ability

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.720
But it's important to recognize that without equipment, the human build

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.880
isn't necessarily unstoppable

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.400
The decision to not have fur granted humans a massive buff to mobility at the cost of stealth

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.440
In the mammal faction, fur is the prerequisite to

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.180
all the major stealth abilities camouflage

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.880
And lack of stealth abilities means getting in close on their targets is a serious challenge

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.020
The human build's lack of fur also means that

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:32.085
they have very low defense, both from physical attacks and from

00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:33.705
environmental affects.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.120
Bare skin offers almost zero armor

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.255
To the point where even lower weight classes

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:41.075
Have no trouble dealing damage to humans.

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:44.355
And bare skin also takes quite a bit of damage from the sun too.

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:47.445
Humans are also pretty limited when it come to the power stat.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.020
Physically, they're the weakest of the great apes.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.640
And don't really have any good options for dealing damage

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.195
They lack the classic high damage bite attack that nearly every other non-herbivorous

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.240
build relies on, instead having to resort to blunt attacks like punch and kick.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.720
Which we all know aren't very effective against builds that have thick fur or skin.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.000
The last major weakness that I can see is that they're pretty bad at dealing with stealth.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.080
The lack of night vision means darkness can really hamper their ability to locate targets

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.500
And their lack of a strong sense of smell means camouflage is especially useful against them.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.880
Okay, now let's talk about matchups.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.420
Obviously, a key feature of the human build is being able to craft equipment

00:04:21.475 --> 00:04:24.445
Given basic equipment, like low level armor and hunting gear.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.720
The human's best matchup is going to be against medium-large mammals

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.800
Unlike blunt damage, piercing damage is quite effective versus builds with thick hide.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.480
But on defense, they're actually pretty awful.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.940
A humans only option on defense is against a large mammal is  intimidation.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.240
Unless they've got some crazy high level equipment

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.500
But I'll make a video on power creep later.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.475
The classic equipment cannot stop a charging tank main

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.000
Unless the intimidate attempt works.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.560
But overall, this matchup is one of the reasons humans became top tier.

00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:54.735
Hardly any builds have favorable matchups against tanks.

00:04:54.735 --> 00:04:57.725
But that's not to say that humans don't have their counters though

00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:00.795
As I said before, stealth can be really effective against them

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.380
due to their lack of a keen sense of smell and night vision.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.960
Humans have the ability to win pretty much any fight as long as they've got time to prepare

00:05:07.095 --> 00:05:10.215
But, taken by surprise, humans have lot fewer options

00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:13.235
Another thing humans have trouble dealing with is flight.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.720
Even when a human has a ranged weapon,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.715
players with high aerial mobility are pretty safe during flight

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:21.485
Now as far as I know, there aren't any bird builds powerful

00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:24.045
enough to one shot humans, which is important because blunt

00:05:24.045 --> 00:05:27.065
attacks like punches are actually quite effective against birds

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.060
Birds have hollow bones that are resistant to tension and torsion, but not compression

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.160
This is the opposite of mammal bones,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.960
which are resistant to compression and tension, but not torsion.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.280
The point is, birds aren't the best choice against humans, but,

00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:41.915
flight has been unlocked by four different classes in the game

00:05:42.315 --> 00:05:45.125
Birds, which we just discussed aren't a good choice, bats,

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:47.245
which do even less damage than birds.

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:50.105
Reptiles, which unfortunately had their arial builds banned in

00:05:50.105 --> 00:05:53.555
in patch 1.3.1 and insects

00:05:53.945 --> 00:05:56.515
Flying, eusocial insects have, by far, the

00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:58.855
best matchup versus humans in the entire game.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.240
Humans have zero counterplay options against a swarm of stinging insects.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.120
I mean, sure, there are special items that they can use to combat swarms if they're prepared.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.460
But the amount of human mains who've chosen that as one of their prestige abilities

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.380
is pretty small.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.675
Humans lack of fur means they have no innate defense against stings.

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:17.725
Stings also have the chance to proc the anaphylaxis debuff,

00:06:17.725 --> 00:06:19.455
which can actually lead to a game over

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:23.165
And it's for this reason that the high score for human eleminations

00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:25.580
Belongs to the africanized honey bee,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.980
known better by its community given name, the killer bee.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.040
And even if the stings don't proc the allergic reaction effect,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.955
They will still definitely achieve their primary goal of dropping their

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.320
resolve to zero and granting you control over the territory

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.460
And we can see that lately the viability of killer bees has only been growing now that they've expanded their territory outside of Africa

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.360
Which brings me to my main point,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.160
Are humans overpowered?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.520
Well, just like the africanized honey bee,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.080
Humans only really became OP once they escaped the African server, and invaded other areas.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.040
Notice how humans took down megafauna across every terrestrial server except Africa

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.580
The African tank mains have the matchup experience and counterplay options

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.880
to deal with the vast array of skills humans have access to.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.440
But the rest of the community was totally unprepared to deal with the rapid

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:12.125
invasion of new human mains invading their competitive scene.

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:14.125
In other words, the devs could have prevented

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:17.720
the massive destabilization of the current meta if they'd region locked humans

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.880
Staying competitive in the meta requires a good player constantly be leveling up their skills.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.780
There's no better example of this than the rapid rise to dominance that humans experienced

00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:29.945
