should<00:04:03.530><c> be</c><00:04:03.709><c> like</c><00:04:03.980><c> a</c><00:04:04.010><c> 1585</c><00:04:04.970><c> CC</c><00:04:05.420><c> so</c><00:04:05.630><c> it's</c><00:04:05.780><c> the</c>

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 align:start position:0%
should be like a 1585 CC so it's the
 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.259 align:start position:0%
should be like a 1585 CC so it's the

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
standard one point leader
yeah<00:04:08.720><c> and</c><00:04:08.959><c> that</c><00:04:09.049><c> made</c><00:04:09.230><c> about</c><00:04:09.470><c> 45</c><00:04:09.980><c> to</c><00:04:10.190><c> 50</c>

we're probably looking maybe two point
 

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.370 align:start position:0%
we're probably looking maybe two point
one<00:11:25.010><c> maybe</c><00:11:25.370><c> two</c><00:11:25.640><c> points</c><00:11:25.910><c> to</c><00:11:26.000><c> you</c><00:11:26.090><c> later</c><00:11:26.300><c> so</c><00:11:26.960><c> yes</c>

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:27.380 align:start position:0%

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:37.790 align:start position:0%
no at the engine yeah but there's not a
 

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.190 align:start position:0%
no at the engine yeah but there's not a

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:43.370 align:start position:0%
of power for a light thing yes that's
 

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.710 align:start position:0%
of power for a light thing yes that's
what<00:11:43.520><c> it'll</c><00:11:43.700><c> do</c><00:11:43.850><c> like</c><00:11:43.940><c> it's</c><00:11:44.210><c> all</c><00:11:44.300><c> about</c><00:11:44.510><c> power</c>

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
