"In the search for life out there, we must first look inward."

00:02:24.254 --> 00:02:28.484
What we see around us is staggering complexity.

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.234
How is it possible?

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.270
"What does it take to create life?"

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.683
"What does it take to create life?"
Living organisms are created by chemistry.

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:43.743
Living organisms are created by chemistry.

00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:48.498
We are huge packages of chemicals.

00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:53.763
And what are the ideal conditions for chemistry?

00:02:54.242 --> 00:02:55.004

What you want is just the right amount

and planets it turns out are just right,

00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:08.826

Well, in gases,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.621
atoms move past each other so fast

00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:35.760
that they can't hitch up.

00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:39.492
In solids, atoms are stuck together.

00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:40.628
They can't move.

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:42.748
In liquids,

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.767
they can cruise and cuddle

00:03:46.847 --> 00:03:49.973
and link up to form molecules.

00:03:56.526 --> 00:04:00.936
Liquid water is just so good for getting evolution going.

00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:02.644
Molecules can dissolve in the water

00:04:02.644 --> 00:04:05.504
to form more complex chains.

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:08.758
Now, where do you find such goldilocks conditions?

00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:11.231
Well, planets are great,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.170
and our early Earth was almost perfect.

4 Billion Years Ago

00:04:25.488 --> 00:04:26.598
It was just the right distance

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:29.734
from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water.

00:04:33.504 --> 00:04:35.226
And deep beneath those oceans,

00:04:35.226 --> 00:04:36.664
at cracks in the Earth's crust,

00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:40.239
fantastic chemistry began to happen

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.503
atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations.

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:09.425 line:1%
"The exact recipe is still a mystery, but the ingredients for life
are simple - energy, organic molecules, and liquid water."

00:05:30.406 --> 00:05:37.846 line:1%
"Somewhere in the seas of early Earth, basic chemistry 
became biology - perhaps even more than once."

00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:50.075 line:1%
"The first cells were likely born in hot volcanic waters,
in conditions once thought impossible for biology."

00:05:52.198 --> 00:05:59.188
"The closer we study life, the more extreme places we find it thriving."

00:05:59.188 --> 00:05:59.898
"The closer we study life, the more extreme places we find it thriving."
Here on our planet,

00:05:59.898 --> 00:06:01.238
Here on our planet,

00:06:01.324 --> 00:06:02.754
microbes have adapted

00:06:02.754 --> 00:06:06.254
to survive the most hostile conditions.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.390

in trenches under thousands of tons of pressure

00:06:16.613 --> 00:06:18.953
in the ocean deeps.

00:06:21.237 --> 00:06:24.507
In the vacuum of a space simulator,

00:06:24.597 --> 00:06:28.617
life forms have been flourishing for years

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:33.312
without oxygen.

00:06:33.886 --> 00:06:40.136 line:1%
"New research suggests that life emerged over 4 billion years ago,
when Earth was an alien and deadly place."

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:50.488 line:1%
"The planet was ravaged by intense volcanism 
and an asteroid storm that lasted 100 million years."

00:07:04.514 --> 00:07:09.914
"Yet even in these extreme conditions,
life quickly found a foothold."

00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:11.149
"Yet even in these extreme conditions,
life quickly found a foothold."
Very very quickly,

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:12.473
Very very quickly,

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:15.783
as soon as the Earth cooled off after its formation,

00:07:15.873 --> 00:07:20.953
we know that life began here.

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:25.228
Because it happened quickly here on Earth,

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.798
we think it is going to happen quickly

00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:28.948
on other planets as well.

00:07:39.664 --> 00:07:46.611 line:1%
"The story of Earth gives us hope that life could be universally common."

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:54.870 line:1%
"It teaches us that life is fast acting, tenacious, 
and made of basic, common ingredients."

00:07:57.971 --> 00:08:05.961 line:1%
"After 4 billion years of isolation, 
the search for our cosmic kin has finally begun."

00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:17.401 line:1%
"Where there is water, there is life - and so our best chance
is to look for ocean worlds like Earth."

00:08:20.577 --> 00:08:27.917 line:1%
"Our search for Earth-like planets has only just begun,
and the findings are tantalizing."
