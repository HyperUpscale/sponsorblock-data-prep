00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.407
- Sup you beautiful bastards.

00:00:01.407 --> 00:00:03.150
Hope you're having a fantastic Thursday.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.960
Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco Show.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.770
Buckle up, hit that like button

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.200
and let's just jump into it.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.790
And the first thing we're
gonna talk about today is,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.160
I would actually like to issue an apology.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.250
This morning after the Astros
apology press conference,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.900
I don't know if you're
unfamiliar with the situation.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.970
They were exposed for cheating,

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.510
breaking the rules during a
World Series season for them

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.340
and this morning among a number
of interviews Astros Owner,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.640
Jim Crane was giving an interview

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.650
and he contradicted himself
about a minute apart.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.640
- You know our opinion is that
this didn't impact the game.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.540
We had a good team, we
won the world series

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.340
and we'll leave it at that.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.950
- [Interviewer] Jim, when
talking about the Yankees there

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.760
did you say you feel like
this didn't impact the game?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.750
And what do you mean by that?

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.490
- I didn't say it didn't impact the game.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.708
You know our opinion is that
this didn't impact the game.

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:52.613
- Right so he says our opinion is

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:56.390
that it didn't impact the game,
then just 55 seconds later

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.470
he says, I didn't say it
didn't impact the game.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.300
My response to that was,
"lol, fuck the Astros."

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.320
And before I just threw out
that tweet without thinking,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.290
I didn't think of the impact it could have

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.310
and the next thing that I saw is,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.140
and I hate saying this because

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:14.790
Jake unfollowed me.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.070
He let me know that he
unfollowed me in a tweet

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.950
and I, I'd like to just
give him an apology

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.140
to Jake as well as anyone else offended.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.190
I would just like to,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.300
and I would just like to

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.630
take this moment to say sorry,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.777
both to Jake and also
to everyone else that

00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:34.860
didn't want Jake to leave
and you know sometimes we,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.270
we come up short and so I
want everyone to know that

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.180
moving forward I will not tweet things

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.860
in fear of someone having
a negative reaction

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.230
to that statement, he said, sarcastically.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.120
Also, ah, once again, fuck the Astros!

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.360
Or rather, because that is kind of a broad

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.140
and forever statement, fuck Jim Crane

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.390
and then distribute it to others based

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.310
off of their involvement and
knowledge of all this cheating.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.720
Fuck all those players and
people involved in that.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.640
And I mean that in the metaphorical sense,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.800
not the physical sense

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.280
cause I know y'all love banging things.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.540
But yeah, especially Jim
Crane, the man made no sense.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.700
- [Marly] Jim, sign stealing
is a distinct advantage

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.083
for the hitter, so how is it

00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:13.140
that it doesn't affect competition?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.323
So then what are you guys apologizing for?

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.083
- We're apologizing
because we broke the rules.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.980
- [Marly] But isn't
sign stealing a distinct

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.813
advantage for the hitter?

00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:28.243
So doesn't it automatically
impact competition?

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.230
- It could possibly do
that, it could possibly not.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.570
- But yeah, Baseball
fans, I'd love to know

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.285
your thoughts around this, but, moving on.

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:37.440
Then let's talk about
Jim Carrey in the news,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.190
if you don't know he's
in the new Sonic movie,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.640
he plays Doctor Robotnik.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.350
Jim Carrey is a very interesting man.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.620
I was actually looking forward

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.890
to him doing press for this movie.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.810
Kind of side note here, if you've never

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.590
seen the documentary "Jim &amp; Andy",

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.190
I believe it's still on Netflix.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.023
Definitely watch it.

00:02:52.023 --> 00:02:54.430
You definitely get a
greater and more raw insight

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.390
into who Jim Carrey is.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.370
Kind of amazing, but nerve wracking

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.320
and uncomfortable to watch, yeah.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.650
But, back on topic, Jim
Carrey's been doing press

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.602
and we've gotten some fun
moments of just him kind of just

00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:06.690
instantly switching into the Grinch,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.760
but then we've also seen a
moment where Jim Carrey has

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.790
gotten blasted for being,
what people have called,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.160
sexist and inappropriate.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.000
This where they described
as an unsolicited

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.580
sexual comment towards an interviewer.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.250
The interviewer is Charlotte
Long, from UK's Heat magazine,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.710
and this is the clip that
people are talking about.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.090
- And in the film,
Sonic has a bucket list,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.350
and I was wondering after all
you've done in your career

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.853
and in your life, is there anything

00:03:25.853 --> 00:03:27.670
still left on your bucket list?

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.920
- Just you.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.494
- Oh, (laughs) Wow!

00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:31.440
- That's it.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.603
It's all done now.

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:36.313
- I don't know what to say to that.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.224
- Just own it.

00:03:38.224 --> 00:03:40.360
(laughs)
- Okay, I'm owning it now.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.193
- Right, and so following that

00:03:41.193 --> 00:03:43.170
we have people calling
him a massive sleazebag,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.580
saying he was totally inappropriate.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.250
But we also saw fans defending him,

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.107
one writing, "He made a
joke, joke didn't land.

00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:49.252
"Everyone is so offended about everything.

00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:50.557
"If a female comedian said that

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:51.967
"about someone we'd all laugh.

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:53.584
"The hypocrisy is ridiculous."

00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:55.740
But with that said, as
far as my opinion on this,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.440
I actually land in the camp of,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.390
I think the joke is being misinterpreted.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.840
For me personally, when I watch that clip

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.040
it feels like he's saying,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.710
you know being interviewed by you,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.700
that's on my bucket list,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.930
it's kind of like a throw away joke.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.200
Right when these press tours happen,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.891
they plop the celebrities in
these kind of cramped rooms,

00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:11.420
there's a ton of light,
it's all of a sudden

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.970
you have all these
interviewers just popping in,

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.590
popping out every five, 10 minutes.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.210
And so I just took it as a
kind of lighthearted joke

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.790
of him like, this is happening,
I finally actually made it.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.930
And so in general to me the people who are

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.220
kind of angry here are
either also misinterpreting

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.650
or they're projecting and
it feels overly sensitive.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.240
But with that said, that's a story

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.550
and my personal take away and of course,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.687
I'd love to know your
thoughts on this one.

00:04:29.687 --> 00:04:32.201
And then, lets talk about the
continuing war against Huawei.

00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.130
Right, and so this has
been an ongoing situation,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.470
a developing situation.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.960
Several days ago we had US officials

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.570
saying Huawei equipment
has secret back doors.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.960
With White house national
security advisor Robert O'brien

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.220
saying, "We have evidence
that Huawei has the capability

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.369
secretly to access sensitive
and personal information

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:49.110
in systems it maintains and
sells around the world."

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.850
Right, and this was big
news, a big announcement

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.630
because the United States for
a while now has been trying

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.920
to get allies to reject Huawei equipment

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.010
in their 5G networks.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.010
Now regarding that claim,
Huawei of course has denied

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.877
the allegations saying it,

00:04:58.877 --> 00:05:00.760
"Has never and will never
do anything that would

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.968
compromise or endanger the security

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.930
of networks and data of its clients."

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.840
With the chairman of
Hauwei even going on to

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.673
say regarding evidence,

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:08.487
"If you have proof or evidence,
it should be made known,

00:05:08.487 --> 00:05:11.050
maybe not to Huawei and
maybe not to the public,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.350
but to telecom operators,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.087
because they are the
ones that buy Huawei."

00:05:14.087 --> 00:05:15.440
"There has never been
any evidence that our

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.830
equipment poses a security threat."

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.510
And so essentially
saying put up, or shut up

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.024
regarding evidence that it appears

00:05:20.024 --> 00:05:21.740
that the United States says that it has.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.980
And now what we're seeing
in addition to that today

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.930
is kind of the continuation
of a campaign where the U.S.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.340
justice department hitting Huawei

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.760
and its CFO with 16 charges.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.097
The indictment announced
today reportedly including

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:34.820
charges of racketeering
as well as conspiracy

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.080
to steal trade secrets.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.477
And as Axios pointed out in their report,

00:05:37.477 --> 00:05:39.877
"This superseding indictment
could ratchet up the potential

00:05:39.877 --> 00:05:42.407
"penalties against Huawei,
which was already facing charges

00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:45.140
"for violating U.S. sanctions
against Iran and North Korea."

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.110
Now regarding these charges,

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.865
we saw U.S. attorney Richard Donoghue say,

00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:49.670
"The new charges in this case relate

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.840
to the alleged decades-long
efforts by Huawei,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.070
and several of its subsidiaries,

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.500
both in the U.S. and in the
People's Republic of China,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.270
to misappropriate intellectual property,

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.500
including from six U.S.
technology companies,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.940
in an effort to grow and
operate Huawei's business."

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.177
With Donoghue going on to explain,

00:06:03.177 --> 00:06:05.460
"The misappropriated
intellectual property included

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.436
trade secret information
and copyrighted works,

00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:10.290
such as source code and user
manuals for internet routers,

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.670
antenna technology and
robot testing technology."

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.060
But ultimately that's where we are now.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.690
The situation is still developing,

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.650
its definitely a stress point regarding

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.210
the United States and China,
though not the only one.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.390
But for now, we'll have to
wait to see what else comes out

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.260
and what happens next.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.820
But from that, I want to
share some stuff I love today,

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.190
and today in awesome,
brought to you by Experian.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.560
Experian is empowering

or credit card, like water,
gas, electric, cable,

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.800
and even your cell phone bill.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.123
And as someone who had
horrible credit for years,

00:06:41.123 --> 00:06:42.700
Thank you, college.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.920
Now being on the other end of it,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.830
it is just so incredibly
important to have good credit

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.010
for successes in life and
opportunities in life.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.520
I mean, fixing mine was
definitely one of the best

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.560
and most beneficial things that

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.650
I've done on the business side.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.430

improve your credit scores

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.160

to boost your FICO score
instantly and free today.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.820
The first bit of awesome today

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.240
is just kind of a last minute reminder.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.070
Depending on if this video is on time,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.220
you only have eight to 10
more hours to snag yourself

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.390
a limited edition hoodie,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.626
The Beautiful Bastard in white

00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:30.630
or the Beautiful Bastard in red and black,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.630
then it will go away for I
don't really know how long.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.838
Some stay away forever,
some stay away for months,

00:07:34.838 --> 00:07:36.390
but yeah, if you want to
snag one while you can

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.460
go to ShopDeFranco.com.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.410
Then Gus Johnson gave us, Ooh!

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.950
A kissing women prank,

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.440
but the only woman he
kisses is his grandma.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.660
Like a savage!

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.610
Then, Marvel entertainment

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.520
gave us the Avengers budget explained.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.757
We also got the how it
should have ended for

00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:49.380
"The Rise of Skywalker".

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.490
Then, and I'm very excited by this,

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.217
we got the new trailer for
the new Wes Anderson film,

00:07:52.217 --> 00:07:53.410
"The French Dispatch".

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.970
We also got the teaser
for "The Green Knight".

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.310
We also got to see Zoe
Kravitz on "Hot Ones"

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.110
which, side note, Sean Evans will be

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.220
on the podcast next week.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.258
I post a new one every Wednesday

00:08:01.258 --> 00:08:03.030
and it was great to have Sean on.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.820
Other than Casey, I think
he's the only person

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.940
to have come on now twice.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.130
Will Smith gave us how He
shot "Bad Boys for Life".

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.370
And we had Billie Eilish answering

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.810
questions from an A.I. bot.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.930
If you wanna see the full versions

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.900
of everything I just shared,

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.420
the secret link of the day,
really anything at all,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.260
links as always, are in
the description down below.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.900
And then let's talk
about Michael Bloomberg

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.390
and the 2020 election,
because you know how this week

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.180
we talked about how we could
spend 100 million dollars a day

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.340
from now to election day and
still have 30 billion dollars?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.700
Well it appears that the
billionaire former New York mayor,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.440
who's now running in
the democratic primary,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.810
decided to spend that
access to money on memes.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.570
According to reports as campaign
teamed up with Meme 2020

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.510
which has access to over
a dozen meme accounts

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.300
totalling 60 million followers.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.530
Notably Mick Pazicy is the
lead strategist of the company.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.510
He's also the chief
executive of jerryMEDIA,

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.860
which if that sounds familiar,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.310
it's probably for a couple of reasons.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.330
First, they help promote the
the infamous Fyre festival,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.260
then later producing a Netflix documentary

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.170
about it which was, I know
there were several of them.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.670
Unsurprisingly their doc was the one

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.630
that made them seem less
like one of the villains.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.590
They also run the Fuckjerry
Instagram account,

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.930
which is faced a lot of backlash

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.570
for stealing jokes and not crediting them.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.130
Though that has really not stopped them,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.010
that page alone has 14.9
million followers, right?

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.000
So an extensive reach.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.950
And thanks to the partnership
with the Bloomberg campaign,

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.040
it's also one of the pages that

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.830
Bloomberg has actually
had memes posted on.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.060
And in general all of these memes,

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.400
all of these posts have
kind of the same theme,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.430
it's an old politician
billionaire who's out of touch

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.830
with the youth trying to seem cool.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:21.677
To which you hear that and you're like

00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:23.800
"Oh, you mean like Pokemon Go to the poles

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.480
with Hilary Clinton in 2016,"

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.700
which there is a similarity
but the difference here

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.520
would be that the Bloomberg
campaign is trying

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.960
to position themselves as
their also in on the joke.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.610
Right, and even if that
effort doesn't work,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.470
it's still so odd that people
will likely talk about it.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.330
Right, it's kind of like
when Bloomberg's team posted

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.020
this weird meatball photo with
Mike's face on a meatball,

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.720
he gets his name and kind
of face out there more,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.280
and more and more just like
as you become a bigger part

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.224
of the conversation more and more,

00:09:49.224 --> 00:09:51.360
maybe that will end up
leading to more votes

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.307
down the road once you go,

00:09:52.307 --> 00:09:53.890
"Oh yeah, the weird meme guy."

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.190
And the thing is, unlike a
lot of paid sponsorships,

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.450
a lot of these posts blew the hell up,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.050
also I'm talking about it,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.930
a ton of people are
talking about this story.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.330
And I believe, and it's not
really an unpopular opinion,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.440
that a lot of the reason
this spread so much

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.282
is that a lot of people were
like, this is very weird,

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:10.840
this can't actually be a
real paid sponsorship right?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.260
This is kind of just a meme.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.120
Right, the meme is that
he has so much money,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.080
he would pay but, no, he actually did it.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.980
And this is also not their
kind of first dabbling

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.670
in this space, I mean
they spont a ton of money

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.436
on the Facebook ads, also
reportedly had offered influencers

00:10:21.436 --> 00:10:23.510
money for sponsored posts in the past.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.583
Now as far as the rest of
the social media reaction,

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.990
it was kind of mixed.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.810
You know some expressing
praise and support.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:29.907
We also had people saying things like,

00:10:29.907 --> 00:10:31.510
"This sucks, unfollow."

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.185
Model and actress Emily
Ratajkowski commented,

00:10:33.185 --> 00:10:34.880
"This is not a good look for you."

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.940
Avet Jewish was definitely
in the meme space

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.630
with 11 million followers commented

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.440
on one of the posts saying
that he was actually offered

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.584
to do this but turned it
down, citing that he grew up

00:10:42.584 --> 00:10:44.174
in New York and really
disagreed with Bloomberg's

00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:46.840
stop and frisk, and anti-marijuana stance.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.690
Also, we've seen people
talking about this on Twitter

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.897
with things like, "If Mike
Bloomberg is genuinely paying the

00:10:50.897 --> 00:10:53.207
"meme accounts I follow on
Instagram to advertise for his

00:10:53.207 --> 00:10:54.947
"campaign it's not gonna work, my man.

00:10:54.947 --> 00:10:56.030
"You're not buying my vote."

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.147
Others writing, "Anyone
sharing a pro Bloomberg meme

00:10:58.147 --> 00:10:59.890
"is forever canceled, pass it on."

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.520
Now with all of that said,
I will say I do think

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.290
that it is hard to argue
that this was not effective,

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.150
because whether you
liked those posts or not,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.920
the name Michael Bloomberg, nationally,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.880
is being said more and more,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.800
in association to running for president.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.633
And will it be effective?

00:11:13.633 --> 00:11:15.830
We have to wait as see the
polls, we have to wait and see

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.400
what actually happens on super Tuesday.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.560
Familiarity with the candidate

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.450
can be a driving factor when voting.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.900
And with so many democrats running,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.480
and so many moderates splitting up

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.610
the moderate vote right now,

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.680
this might actually become something.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.860
I do also wonder though if
there'll be any more fallout

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.980
regarding these meme accounts
because even though these

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.940
are paid sponsorships, because
the content that is being

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.080
delivered to the consumer is

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.020
being done on a channel level, right?

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.783
This is me saying this,

00:11:38.783 --> 00:11:40.350
I think a number of people
are going to conflate it

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.490
as essentially a paid endorsement.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.930
But if you're willing to
take money from a candidate

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.260
it essentially seems like a thumbs up.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.250
We don't know the affect of
this there but its also sparked

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.940
a larger conversation around social media

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.150
and political endorsements.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.430
Right, because a lot of names have gotten

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.170
very vocal about the 2020 election.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.410
I mean the two names come to mind,

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.670
and have very big audiences online,

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.010
you have the likes of Joe Rogan,

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.948
and Ethan Cline who've
endorsed Bernie Sanders.

00:11:59.948 --> 00:12:02.370
Rogan on his podcast, saying
that he would likely vote

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.730
for Sanders then Sanders' team ended up

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.280
using that essentially as a political ad.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.510
And following that, I
don't know if you remember,

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.390
there was a lot of backlash on Twitter,

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.260
there were articles about
how it was a bad thing.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.620
Though, and I might be misremembering it,

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.437
I feel like The Onion did
a piece, there was like

00:12:14.437 --> 00:12:16.935
"Oh, Bernie Sanders exposed
of trying to get people

00:12:16.935 --> 00:12:19.710
"to vote for him that aren't
just pure progressives."

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.687
But even there, there is a
debate about how impactful

00:12:21.687 --> 00:12:23.760
celebrity endorsements like this can be.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.130
Though I will say VICE wrote that piece

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.500
about Rogan's endorsement is actually

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.410
one of the most influential in America.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.267
Saying, "Rogan's endorsement
doesn't depend on whether Rogan

00:12:30.267 --> 00:12:31.857
"himself is good or bad, it's whether

00:12:31.857 --> 00:12:33.377
"his endorsement moves the needle.

00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:35.017
"And given how much discussion there is

00:12:35.017 --> 00:12:36.757
"about his endorsement and what we know

00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:39.220
"about Rogan's overall influence,
it almost certainly does."

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.960
But as far as how effective
it ended up being,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.230
I mean, I think it's hard to say,

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.950
because there's not just one thing that's

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.210
happening at any given moment,

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.140
it's hard to tell the difference

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.860
between causation and correlation.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.840
And so actually with all that said,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.470
I did wanna ask you
two key questions here,

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.230
One, what are your feelings
and reactions to meme 2020

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.580
and Fuckjerry and getting involved

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.650
with the the Bloomberg campaign?

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.500
And two, regarding celebrity endorsements,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.360
right, where there's no
money being exchanged,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.231
what are your thoughts around that?

00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:04.410
Has anyone that has ever done that

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.610
influenced you in some way?

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.013
Has a Rogan or a Cline or a, whoever,

00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:11.040
saying this is someone that
I'm probably gonna vote for,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.400
or this who I'm supporting, moved you?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.233
Whether it be to go,

00:13:14.233 --> 00:13:15.700
"Okay I'm actually going
to vote for that person,"

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.377
or two, "Hey I'm going to look

00:13:17.377 --> 00:13:18.770
"a little more into this person."

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.440
And that is where I'm
going to end today's show.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.680
