00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.270
By the 1960’s, the idea that a jet could
take off and land vertically was no longer

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.800
the stuff of science fiction, and freeing
jets from needing runways was

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189
going to revolutionize their use.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.419
While the British led the way with the first
jump jet fighter, Germany set out to build

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.030
something even more ambitious.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.649
The world’s first vertical jet lift transport,
combining the speed and range of a jet with

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.350
more lifting power than just about any helicopter
in the world.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.519
This was a plane that would revolutionize
Germany’s air force.

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.070
A truly versatile machine that could even
redefine air travel itself.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:05.110
But developing the world’s first VTOL transport
would be fraught with technical challenges.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:14.430
It’s called Vertical Take Off and Landing,
or VTOL.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.740
And getting a jet to do it would prove to
be one of the most difficult challenges in

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.840
aviation history.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.750
Without forward motion, a plane’s wings
can’t generate any lift, and it means a

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.060
VTOL jet must rely entirely on its engines
to get airborne, by directing thrust downwards.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.860
But making enough power to lift off vertically
is only part of the challenge.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.880
Jet thrust must also keep the aircraft stable
and oriented.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.030
Because while hovering, conventional control
surfaces aren’t able to control the aircraft.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.820
And a VTOL jet still needs to fly like a conventional
plane.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.510
And one approach is to use dedicated lift
jets to get airborne and a separate jet for

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.490
conventional forward flight.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.710
Another approach is to develop an engine that
can do both.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.330
Vector thrust downwards for vertical lift
and rearwards for forward flight.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.880
A third way is to combine dedicated lift jets
and vectored thrust.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.850
These were enormous engineering challenges.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.450
But throughout the 1960s, several countries
launched VTOL jet development programs.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.890
Because freeing jets from needing runways
could make all the difference in the next

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.800
major conflict.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.010
During the Second World War, a grass field
was just about all that military aircraft

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.880
needed to get airborne.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.400
Grass fields are hard to destroy and easy
to replace.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.170
And a World War Two-era fighter needed only
a few hundred feet of it.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.460
But in little over a decade that all changed.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.380
Because jet aircraft needed thousands of feet
of concrete runway to get airborne, creating

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.800
a strategic vulnerability.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.209
In the opening hours of a conflict, runways
were going to be the first targets and their

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.230
destruction would render an entire air force
inoperable.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.030
During the Cold War, nowhere was this vulnerability
more apparent than in West Germany, where

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.120
most air bases were just a few hundred kilometers
from Soviet Bloc countries.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.220
Within easy striking distance of aircraft
and cruise missiles.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.400
But VTOL jets could operate without runways.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.569
And for West Germany, the technology seemed
like the perfect solution.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.840
Because aircraft could be stationed throughout
the country, away from threats.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.510
Kept hidden under the cover of forests or
inside buildings Aircraft could even use the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.290
country’s Autobahn highway network to stage
operations.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.100
In 1960, West Germany set out to build an
air force around VTOL technology.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.980
Starting with the development of a supersonic
fighter with unique pivoting wing-tip jets

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.980
engines.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.620
A year later, work also began on a VTOL strike
fighter, a ground attack aircraft to serve

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.700
as the mainstay of West-
German air force.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.870
But critical for supporting these aircraft
out in the field would be a jet lift transport.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.590
A plane that could deliver supplies and personnel
to remote forward operating bases.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.000
And in 1962, West German aircraft builder
Dornier was assigned the enormous challenge

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.750
of developing it.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.969
Getting a jet to lift off vertically was difficult
enough.

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:26.610
A VTOL transport would also need to lift several
tons of cargo.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.159
And to do it, engineers would need to develop
everything from new flight control systems,

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:42.340
engine layouts, to avionics.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.599
This is the Dornier Do-31.

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.379
The world’s only vertical jet lift transport.

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:55.090
Using the combined power of two vectored thrust
turbofans and eight lift jets in wing-tip

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.360
pods, the Do 31 could generate an incredible
66,000 pounds of thrust.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.590
More vertical lifting power than just about
any helicopter in the world.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.009
To keep the aircraft stable, engineers developed
an advanced computerized flight control system.

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.460
Working around the limits of 1960’s technology
with an innovative part-digital, part-analog

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.449
hybrid computer.

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.600
In forward flight, the lift jets would be
shut off and the Do 31

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.680
would fly like a conventional plane.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.180
And it could reach speeds of over 700km an
hour and carry 36 fully equipped troops or

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.439
nearly six tons of cargo.

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:37.990
An unprecedented combination of speed, range
and lifting capacity.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.289
But developing the world’s first VTOL jet
transport would be fraught with technical

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.289
challenges.

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.580
And it took Dornier almost five years to develop
the Do 31’s technologies.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.520
But by 1967, confidence in the aircraft was
growing and soon test flights were proving

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.439
that Germany’s jet lift transport was more
than capable of fulfilling it’s design mission.

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:06.300
And as Dornier moved closer to a production
version, some even saw the potential for vertical

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.720
jet lift technology to revolutionize commercial
aviation.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.100
Because VTOL airliners would operate from
helipads, maybe even directly

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.650
from building rooftops.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.349
But VTOL jet travel was going to have to wait.

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:30.580
As the 1960s drew to a close, the Cold War
evolved into a new phase.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.129
An all out war with the Soviet Union now seemed
less likely.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:40.319
And it meant the development of VTOL capable
jets was now less of a strategic priority.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:46.400
And getting a jet to reliably take off and
land vertically proved to be far more challenging

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.580
and dangerous than originally anticipated.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.900
By 1968 it was clear that Germany’s VTOL
fighter jet wasn't going to

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.960
meet it’s design objectives.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.619
And with rising development costs the program
was cancelled.

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:05.589
And that put the future of Do 31 in doubt

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:09.200
More than anything, what west Germany needed
was a partner

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.219
to help shoulder development costs.

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:16.199
And while Dornier managed to get the attention
of the U.S military and aerospace industry,

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:18.719
partnerships never materialized.

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:23.460
Like other VTOL jets, the Do 31 had some serious
limitations.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.539
Sure, its ten jets could lift more than just
about any helicopter in the world.

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:33.259
Much of what they were actually lifting was
the aircraft's own weight.

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:37.919
Ten jet engines and the fuel needed to keep
them all running made the Do 31 incredibly

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.000
complex and heavy.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.180
And the noise would've been a deal breaker
for any civil application.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:50.229
Dornier tried to impress crowds at the 1969
Paris air show, flying alongside Britain's

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.940
harrier jump jet in a coordinated aerial display.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.439
But excitement over VTOL was starting to fade
and the plane garnered little in the way of

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:01.169
serious interest.

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:04.800
And without a development partner or buyers,
Dornier was forced to

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.889
cancel the project in 1970.

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:12.939
The attack aircraft it was intended to support
would eventually suffer a similar fate.

00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:19.409
Of the many VTOL projects launched in the
1950s and 60s, most would end in failure.

00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:24.449
Unable to overcome monumental engineering
challenges or the inherent limitations of

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:26.159
jet lift technology

00:08:26.159 --> 00:08:37.349
The world’s only jet lift transport promised
to combine the speed and range of a jet, with

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:39.349
the versatility of a helicopter.

00:08:39.349 --> 00:08:44.000
A machine designed to address a pressing strategic
challenge.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.640
Decades earlier Japanese engineers were also
trying to solve their own strategic problem.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:56.040
And their solution would be to combine the
stealth of a submarine with the strike capabilities

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.790
of an aircraft carrier.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:02.899
Japan’s underwater aircraft carriers were
some of the most fascinating machines to come

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:04.550
out of the Second World War.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.670
