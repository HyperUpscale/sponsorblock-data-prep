00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 align:start position:0%
simply if you spin it and then you take
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.010 align:start position:0%
simply if you spin it and then you take
a<00:01:34.680><c> snapshot</c><00:01:35.130><c> what</c><00:01:36.060><c> does</c><00:01:36.210><c> the</c><00:01:36.329><c> snapshot</c><00:01:36.840><c> look</c>

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
a snapshot what does the snapshot look
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
a snapshot what does the snapshot look
like<00:01:37.229><c> okay</c><00:01:37.860><c> so</c><00:01:37.920><c> so</c><00:01:38.430><c> what</c><00:01:38.460><c> what</c><00:01:38.640><c> stress</c><00:01:39.030><c> is</c><00:01:39.150><c> a</c>

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 align:start position:0%

your<00:01:40.590><c> description</c><00:01:41.070><c> was</c><00:01:41.189><c> this</c><00:01:41.340><c> you</c><00:01:41.579><c> said</c><00:01:41.790><c> that</c>

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 align:start position:0%
your description was this you said that
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.749 align:start position:0%
your description was this you said that
the<00:01:42.840><c> water</c><00:01:43.170><c> would</c><00:01:43.380><c> come</c><00:01:43.560><c> out</c><00:01:43.590><c> and</c><00:01:44.009><c> then</c><00:01:44.670><c> it</c>

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 align:start position:0%
the water would come out and then it
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 align:start position:0%
the water would come out and then it
would<00:01:44.880><c> kind</c><00:01:45.000><c> of</c><00:01:45.090><c> go</c><00:01:45.149><c> like</c><00:01:45.270><c> this</c><00:01:45.560><c> and</c><00:01:46.560><c> it</c><00:01:46.860><c> would</c>

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
would kind of go like this and it would
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 align:start position:0%
would kind of go like this and it would
be<00:01:47.009><c> back</c><00:01:47.189><c> here</c><00:01:47.430><c> like</c><00:01:47.579><c> that</c><00:01:47.700><c> okay</c><00:01:47.970><c> so</c><00:01:48.060><c> we</c><00:01:48.180><c> take</c><00:01:48.299><c> a</c>

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
be back here like that okay so we take a
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.060 align:start position:0%
be back here like that okay so we take a
snapshot<00:01:48.509><c> and</c><00:01:48.869><c> it</c><00:01:49.079><c> looks</c><00:01:49.290><c> like</c><00:01:49.380><c> that</c><00:01:49.740><c> well</c><00:01:50.040><c> I</c>

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 align:start position:0%
snapshot and it looks like that well I
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.649 align:start position:0%
snapshot and it looks like that well I
think<00:01:50.159><c> that</c><00:01:50.520><c> happens</c><00:01:50.909><c> but</c><00:01:51.090><c> I</c><00:01:51.149><c> think</c><00:01:51.360><c> it</c><00:01:51.450><c> also</c>

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 align:start position:0%
think that happens but I think it also
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
think that happens but I think it also
it<00:01:52.470><c> also</c><00:01:52.500><c> goes</c><00:01:52.890><c> in</c><00:01:53.070><c> the</c><00:01:53.130><c> direction</c><00:01:53.430><c> of</c>

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 align:start position:0%
it also goes in the direction of
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.060 align:start position:0%
it also goes in the direction of
rotation<00:01:53.759><c> okay</c><00:01:54.570><c> this</c><00:01:55.020><c> is</c><00:01:55.200><c> a</c><00:01:55.320><c> way</c><00:01:55.500><c> to</c><00:01:55.560><c> think</c>

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 align:start position:0%
rotation okay this is a way to think
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
rotation okay this is a way to think
about<00:01:56.250><c> it</c><00:01:56.520><c> in</c><00:01:57.180><c> two</c><00:01:57.509><c> steps</c><00:01:57.810><c> okay</c><00:01:58.259><c> because</c><00:01:58.469><c> if</c>

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 align:start position:0%
about it in two steps okay because if
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.109 align:start position:0%
about it in two steps okay because if
the<00:01:59.009><c> question</c><00:01:59.310><c> is</c><00:01:59.399><c> too</c><00:01:59.520><c> complicated</c><00:01:59.820><c> just</c>

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
the question is too complicated just
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 align:start position:0%
the question is too complicated just
simplify<00:02:00.689><c> it</c><00:02:00.750><c> and</c><00:02:00.899><c> then</c><00:02:01.020><c> you</c><00:02:01.110><c> might</c><00:02:01.259><c> get</c><00:02:01.409><c> there</c>

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 align:start position:0%
simplify it and then you might get there
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.850 align:start position:0%
simplify it and then you might get there
okay<00:02:02.399><c> so</c><00:02:02.939><c> this</c><00:02:03.060><c> the</c><00:02:03.479><c> chants</c><00:02:04.350><c> are</c><00:02:04.469><c> just</c><00:02:04.619><c> coming</c>

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
okay so this the chants are just coming
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 align:start position:0%
okay so this the chants are just coming
out<00:02:04.950><c> like</c><00:02:05.159><c> this</c><00:02:05.219><c> okay</c><00:02:05.640><c> okay</c><00:02:05.780><c> and</c><00:02:06.780><c> so</c><00:02:06.869><c> we're</c>

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 align:start position:0%
out like this okay okay and so we're
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
out like this okay okay and so we're
gonna<00:02:07.079><c> spin</c><00:02:07.380><c> it</c><00:02:07.500><c> this</c><00:02:07.649><c> way</c>

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 align:start position:0%
gonna spin it this way
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.220 align:start position:0%
gonna spin it this way
and<00:02:09.269><c> then</c><00:02:09.629><c> now</c><00:02:09.959><c> maybe</c><00:02:10.319><c> you</c><00:02:10.530><c> have</c><00:02:10.709><c> an</c><00:02:10.799><c> intuitive</c>

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 align:start position:0%
and then now maybe you have an intuitive
 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.819 align:start position:0%
and then now maybe you have an intuitive
understanding<00:02:13.230><c> of</c><00:02:13.290><c> what's</c><00:02:13.560><c> gonna</c><00:02:13.739><c> happen</c>

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's gonna happen
 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's gonna happen
when<00:02:14.219><c> you</c><00:02:14.310><c> take</c><00:02:14.459><c> a</c><00:02:14.519><c> snapshot</c><00:02:15.139><c> what</c><00:02:16.139><c> do</c><00:02:16.200><c> you</c>

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 align:start position:0%
when you take a snapshot what do you
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.470 align:start position:0%
when you take a snapshot what do you
think<00:02:16.499><c> so</c><00:02:16.650><c> we</c><00:02:16.739><c> have</c><00:02:16.769><c> angular</c><00:02:17.040><c> momentum</c>

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
think so we have angular momentum
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.330 align:start position:0%
think so we have angular momentum
angular<00:02:18.480><c> momentum</c><00:02:19.109><c> there</c><00:02:19.290><c> right</c><00:02:19.530><c> yeah</c><00:02:19.889><c> and</c><00:02:20.159><c> so</c>

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
angular momentum there right yeah and so
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.890 align:start position:0%
angular momentum there right yeah and so
I<00:02:20.370><c> would</c><00:02:20.639><c> think</c><00:02:20.670><c> that</c><00:02:20.879><c> as</c><00:02:21.150><c> a</c><00:02:21.180><c> particle</c><00:02:21.719><c> comes</c>

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
I would think that as a particle comes
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.890 align:start position:0%
I would think that as a particle comes
out<00:02:22.049><c> here</c><00:02:22.409><c> it</c><00:02:22.590><c> has</c><00:02:22.829><c> some</c><00:02:23.249><c> side</c><00:02:23.549><c> words</c><00:02:23.900><c> velocity</c>

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
out here it has some side words velocity
 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.509 align:start position:0%
out here it has some side words velocity
that's<00:02:25.079><c> that's</c><00:02:25.349><c> a</c><00:02:25.439><c> term</c><00:02:25.620><c> right</c><00:02:25.799><c> side</c><00:02:26.010><c> words</c><00:02:26.250><c> I</c>

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 align:start position:0%
that's that's a term right side words I
 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.449 align:start position:0%
that's that's a term right side words I
slide<00:02:27.150><c> woods</c><00:02:27.389><c> yeah</c><00:02:27.569><c> yeah</c><00:02:27.810><c> yeah</c><00:02:27.959><c> yeah</c><00:02:28.280><c> that's</c><00:02:29.280><c> a</c>

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 align:start position:0%
words I'm from Alabama so it's got some
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.899 align:start position:0%
words I'm from Alabama so it's got some
side<00:02:34.019><c> words</c><00:02:34.260><c> direction</c><00:02:34.769><c> huh</c><00:02:34.980><c> and</c><00:02:35.430><c> so</c><00:02:35.760><c> I</c><00:02:35.790><c> think</c>

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 align:start position:0%
side words direction huh and so I think
 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.099 align:start position:0%
side words direction huh and so I think
what's<00:02:36.180><c> gonna</c><00:02:36.239><c> happen</c><00:02:36.359><c> is</c><00:02:36.719><c> you're</c><00:02:36.810><c> gonna</c><00:02:36.870><c> see</c>

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 align:start position:0%
what's gonna happen is you're gonna see
 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.619 align:start position:0%
what's gonna happen is you're gonna see
a<00:02:37.139><c> curve</c><00:02:37.530><c> get</c><00:02:37.799><c> thrown</c><00:02:38.099><c> out</c><00:02:38.249><c> like</c><00:02:38.280><c> that</c><00:02:38.639><c> okay</c><00:02:39.239><c> so</c>

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 align:start position:0%
a curve get thrown out like that okay so
 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.670 align:start position:0%
a curve get thrown out like that okay so
you<00:02:39.719><c> think</c><00:02:39.780><c> it's</c><00:02:40.079><c> spinning</c><00:02:40.469><c> in</c><00:02:40.590><c> this</c>

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
you think it's spinning in this
 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.860 align:start position:0%
you think it's spinning in this
direction<00:02:41.000><c> the</c><00:02:42.000><c> curve</c><00:02:42.269><c> is</c><00:02:42.450><c> gonna</c><00:02:42.540><c> go</c><00:02:42.750><c> like</c>

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 align:start position:0%
direction the curve is gonna go like
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.309 align:start position:0%
direction the curve is gonna go like
that

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
that
 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.970 align:start position:0%
that
yeah<00:02:44.099><c> I</c><00:02:44.129><c> think</c><00:02:44.400><c> so</c><00:02:44.639><c> okay</c><00:02:45.629><c> am</c><00:02:46.319><c> I</c><00:02:46.439><c> wrong</c><00:02:46.680><c> that's</c>

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so okay am I wrong that's
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so okay am I wrong that's
like<00:02:47.129><c> the</c><00:02:47.280><c> opposite</c><00:02:47.639><c> of</c><00:02:47.760><c> most</c><00:02:47.939><c> people's</c>

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 align:start position:0%
like the opposite of most people's
 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.589 align:start position:0%
like the opposite of most people's
intuition<00:02:48.900><c> why</c><00:02:49.500><c> because</c><00:02:50.280><c> okay</c><00:02:51.150><c> well</c><00:02:51.419><c> most</c>

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
intuition why because okay well most
 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.939 align:start position:0%
intuition why because okay well most
people<00:02:51.750><c> would</c><00:02:51.900><c> say</c><00:02:52.109><c> like</c><00:02:52.439><c> it's</c><00:02:52.590><c> gonna</c><00:02:52.709><c> come</c>

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:52.949 align:start position:0%
people would say like it's gonna come
 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.849 align:start position:0%
people would say like it's gonna come
out<00:02:53.069><c> here</c><00:02:53.310><c> and</c><00:02:53.810><c> it's</c><00:02:54.810><c> gonna</c><00:02:54.959><c> it's</c><00:02:55.349><c> gonna</c><00:02:55.439><c> trail</c>

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
out here and it's gonna it's gonna trail
 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.059 align:start position:0%
out here and it's gonna it's gonna trail
behind<00:02:56.129><c> oh</c><00:02:57.409><c> that</c><00:02:58.409><c> mean</c><00:02:58.530><c> most</c><00:02:58.709><c> people's</c>

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 align:start position:0%
behind oh that mean most people's
 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.890 align:start position:0%
behind oh that mean most people's
situation<00:02:59.639><c> I</c><00:02:59.699><c> think</c><00:02:59.849><c> it's</c><00:03:00.090><c> a</c><00:03:00.269><c> what</c><00:03:00.719><c> should</c><00:03:00.750><c> we</c>

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
situation I think it's a what should we
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.300 align:start position:0%
situation I think it's a what should we
see<00:03:01.019><c> what</c><00:03:01.169><c> happens</c><00:03:01.409><c> well</c><00:03:01.590><c> let's</c><00:03:01.739><c> do</c><00:03:01.829><c> this</c><00:03:01.949><c> then</c>

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 align:start position:0%
see what happens well let's do this then
 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.649 align:start position:0%
see what happens well let's do this then
what<00:03:02.489><c> do</c><00:03:02.549><c> you</c><00:03:02.669><c> like</c><00:03:02.819><c> this</c><00:03:02.969><c> is</c><00:03:03.120><c> the</c><00:03:03.269><c> simpler</c>

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 align:start position:0%
what do you like this is the simpler
 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.149 align:start position:0%
what do you like this is the simpler
puzzle<00:03:03.989><c> so</c><00:03:04.139><c> let's</c><00:03:04.319><c> destroy</c><00:03:04.680><c> this</c><00:03:04.829><c> say</c><00:03:05.010><c> yeah</c>

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
puzzle so let's destroy this say yeah
 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.270 align:start position:0%
puzzle so let's destroy this say yeah
okay<00:03:05.430><c> let</c><00:03:05.579><c> me</c><00:03:05.639><c> set</c><00:03:05.819><c> the</c><00:03:05.909><c> Phantom</c><00:03:06.209><c> Oh</c><00:03:07.189><c> am</c><00:03:08.189><c> I</c>

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
okay let me set the Phantom Oh am I
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
okay let me set the Phantom Oh am I
wrong<00:03:08.489><c> I</c><00:03:08.879><c> think</c><00:03:09.569><c> so</c><00:03:09.989><c> yeah</c><00:03:10.169><c> you</c><00:03:10.799><c> think</c><00:03:10.919><c> I'm</c>

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
wrong I think so yeah you think I'm
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.030 align:start position:0%
wrong I think so yeah you think I'm
wrong<00:03:15.049><c> okay</c><00:03:16.049><c> so</c><00:03:16.290><c> here</c><00:03:16.500><c> we</c><00:03:16.530><c> go</c><00:03:16.620><c> the</c><00:03:16.889><c> first</c>

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
wrong okay so here we go the first
 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.979 align:start position:0%
wrong okay so here we go the first
question<00:03:17.549><c> is</c><00:03:17.790><c> what</c><00:03:18.209><c> happens</c><00:03:18.540><c> with</c><00:03:18.750><c> just</c>

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 align:start position:0%
question is what happens with just
 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.809 align:start position:0%
question is what happens with just
straight<00:03:19.169><c> water</c><00:03:19.439><c> coming</c><00:03:19.829><c> out</c><00:03:19.919><c> and</c><00:03:20.220><c> you</c><00:03:20.609><c> think</c>

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
straight water coming out and you think
 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.179 align:start position:0%
straight water coming out and you think
what's<00:03:21.150><c> gonna</c><00:03:21.269><c> happen</c><00:03:21.629><c> so</c><00:03:22.290><c> I</c><00:03:22.319><c> think</c><00:03:22.470><c> that</c><00:03:22.769><c> the</c>

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 align:start position:0%
what's gonna happen so I think that the
 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.909 align:start position:0%
what's gonna happen so I think that the
you're<00:03:23.790><c> gonna</c><00:03:23.879><c> get</c><00:03:24.030><c> this</c><00:03:24.150><c> curve</c><00:03:24.479><c> of</c><00:03:24.720><c> water</c><00:03:25.019><c> the</c>

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 align:start position:0%
you're gonna get this curve of water the
 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:32.270 align:start position:0%
you're gonna get this curve of water the
trails<00:03:26.720><c> the</c><00:03:27.720><c> motion</c><00:03:28.349><c> of</c><00:03:28.530><c> the</c><00:03:29.400><c> spouts</c><00:03:30.030><c> but</c><00:03:31.280><c> yeah</c>

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
trails the motion of the spouts but yeah
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.530 align:start position:0%
trails the motion of the spouts but yeah
I<00:03:32.310><c> think</c><00:03:32.370><c> it's</c><00:03:32.609><c> gonna</c><00:03:32.729><c> trail</c><00:03:33.030><c> the</c><00:03:33.180><c> motion</c><00:03:33.449><c> of</c>

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
I think it's gonna trail the motion of
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.170 align:start position:0%
I think it's gonna trail the motion of
the<00:03:33.659><c> spout</c><00:03:33.930><c> but</c><00:03:34.199><c> it</c><00:03:34.919><c> could</c><00:03:35.250><c> it</c><00:03:35.579><c> still</c><00:03:35.849><c> it</c><00:03:36.150><c> still</c>

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
the spout but it could it still it still
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.670 align:start position:0%
the spout but it could it still it still
has<00:03:36.449><c> motion</c><00:03:36.810><c> going</c><00:03:36.989><c> in</c><00:03:37.169><c> the</c><00:03:37.259><c> direction</c><00:03:37.530><c> of</c>

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
has motion going in the direction of
 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.140 align:start position:0%
has motion going in the direction of
rotation<00:03:37.829><c> it</c><00:03:38.370><c> does</c><00:03:38.639><c> but</c><00:03:39.180><c> I</c><00:03:39.299><c> but</c><00:03:40.729><c> he</c><00:03:41.729><c> died</c><00:03:41.909><c> he</c>

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 align:start position:0%
rotation it does but I but he died he
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.149 align:start position:0%
rotation it does but I but he died he
does<00:03:42.389><c> you</c><00:03:42.720><c> try</c><00:03:42.870><c> to</c><00:03:42.930><c> make</c><00:03:43.139><c> it</c><00:03:43.229><c> look</c><00:03:43.349><c> is</c><00:03:44.009><c> what</c>

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
does you try to make it look is what
 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.129 align:start position:0%
does you try to make it look is what
you're<00:03:44.280><c> doing</c><00:03:44.310><c> I</c><00:03:44.819><c> just</c><00:03:45.389><c> can't</c><00:03:45.569><c> get</c><00:03:45.629><c> absolutely</c>

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:02.759 align:start position:0%
take a look at that slow motion and see
 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.349 align:start position:0%
take a look at that slow motion and see
why<00:04:03.000><c> Steve</c><00:04:03.389><c> and</c><00:04:03.569><c> I</c><00:04:03.629><c> both</c><00:04:03.930><c> agree</c><00:04:04.349><c> and</c><00:04:04.650><c> disagree</c>

why Steve and I both agree and disagree
so<00:04:06.359><c> yeah</c><00:04:06.479><c> it's</c><00:04:06.659><c> kind</c><00:04:06.840><c> of</c><00:04:06.930><c> it's</c><00:04:07.199><c> it's</c><00:04:07.560><c> trailing</c>

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's kind of it's it's trailing
 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's kind of it's it's trailing
the<00:04:08.310><c> that's</c><00:04:08.579><c> what</c><00:04:08.699><c> I</c><00:04:08.729><c> meant</c><00:04:08.849><c> by</c><00:04:08.939><c> chaining</c><00:04:09.299><c> oh</c>

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 align:start position:0%
the that's what I meant by chaining oh
 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
the that's what I meant by chaining oh
here<00:04:09.449><c> we</c><00:04:09.509><c> go</c><00:04:09.539><c> it</c><00:04:09.810><c> goes</c><00:04:09.930><c> it's</c><00:04:10.229><c> it's</c><00:04:10.949><c> behind</c><00:04:11.370><c> the</c>

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 align:start position:0%
here we go it goes it's it's behind the
 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.580 align:start position:0%
here we go it goes it's it's behind the
direction<00:04:12.000><c> of</c><00:04:12.060><c> motion</c><00:04:12.269><c> right</c><00:04:12.599><c> okay</c><00:04:13.019><c> yeah</c>

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 align:start position:0%
direction of motion right okay yeah
 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
direction of motion right okay yeah
granted<00:04:14.129><c> granted</c><00:04:14.699><c> but</c><00:04:15.629><c> any</c><00:04:16.079><c> individual</c>

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 align:start position:0%
granted granted but any individual
 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.289 align:start position:0%
granted granted but any individual
particle<00:04:17.130><c> is</c><00:04:17.219><c> actually</c><00:04:17.489><c> going</c><00:04:17.639><c> out</c><00:04:17.880><c> in</c><00:04:18.060><c> a</c><00:04:18.150><c> way</c>

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
particle is actually going out in a way
 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.789 align:start position:0%
particle is actually going out in a way
yeah<00:04:18.539><c> it's</c><00:04:18.570><c> so</c><00:04:19.500><c> I'm</c><00:04:19.590><c> not</c><00:04:19.739><c> wrong</c>

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
yeah it's so I'm not wrong
 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.230 align:start position:0%
yeah it's so I'm not wrong
so<00:04:21.799><c> this</c><00:04:21.949><c> is</c><00:04:22.099><c> a</c><00:04:22.129><c> language</c><00:04:22.520><c> problem</c><00:04:22.789><c> if</c><00:04:23.090><c> you</c>

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
so this is a language problem if you
 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.629 align:start position:0%
so this is a language problem if you
look<00:04:23.419><c> at</c><00:04:23.569><c> it</c><00:04:23.719><c> from</c><00:04:24.020><c> the</c><00:04:24.259><c> snapshot</c><00:04:24.770><c> view</c><00:04:25.069><c> you</c>

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
look at it from the snapshot view you
 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.219 align:start position:0%
look at it from the snapshot view you
could<00:04:25.789><c> say</c><00:04:26.030><c> it's</c><00:04:26.180><c> trailing</c><00:04:26.749><c> but</c><00:04:27.020><c> I'm</c><00:04:27.110><c> an</c>

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 align:start position:0%
could say it's trailing but I'm an
 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.629 align:start position:0%
could say it's trailing but I'm an
American<00:04:27.319><c> and</c><00:04:27.860><c> I</c><00:04:28.009><c> think</c><00:04:28.249><c> about</c><00:04:28.370><c> what</c><00:04:28.520><c> that</c>

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
American and I think about what that
 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.969 align:start position:0%
American and I think about what that
particle<00:04:29.210><c> is</c><00:04:29.419><c> seeing</c><00:04:29.840><c> and</c><00:04:30.139><c> experiencing</c><00:04:30.770><c> on</c>

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 align:start position:0%
direction that it left the pipe it looks
 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.869 align:start position:0%
direction that it left the pipe it looks
like<00:05:26.870><c> it's</c><00:05:27.080><c> trailing</c><00:05:27.589><c> but</c><00:05:27.889><c> it's</c><00:05:28.039><c> not</c><00:05:28.279><c> that's</c>

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 align:start position:0%
like it's trailing but it's not that's
 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.450 align:start position:0%
like it's trailing but it's not that's

have<00:05:31.550><c> the</c><00:05:31.819><c> water</c><00:05:32.120><c> jets</c><00:05:32.710><c> flying</c><00:05:33.710><c> into</c><00:05:34.189><c> the</c>

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
have the water jets flying into the
 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.969 align:start position:0%
have the water jets flying into the
center<00:05:34.729><c> you</c><00:05:35.150><c> made</c><00:05:35.300><c> this</c><00:05:35.479><c> just</c><00:05:35.870><c> just</c><00:05:36.409><c> to</c><00:05:36.830><c> get</c>

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 align:start position:0%
center you made this just just to get
 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.570 align:start position:0%
center you made this just just to get
onto<00:05:37.129><c> me</c><00:05:37.370><c> yes</c><00:05:38.740><c> this</c><00:05:39.740><c> was</c><00:05:39.919><c> just</c><00:05:40.159><c> to</c><00:05:40.279><c> get</c><00:05:40.399><c> onto</c>

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 align:start position:0%
onto me yes this was just to get onto
 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:48.429 align:start position:0%
onto me yes this was just to get onto
your<00:05:40.699><c> YouTube</c><00:05:41.240><c> channel</c><00:05:45.580><c> so</c><00:05:46.580><c> my</c><00:05:47.569><c> guess</c><00:05:47.810><c> is</c><00:05:48.020><c> if</c>

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:48.439 align:start position:0%
your YouTube channel so my guess is if
 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:50.050 align:start position:0%
your YouTube channel so my guess is if
we<00:05:48.560><c> if</c><00:05:48.589><c> we</c><00:05:48.830><c> follow</c><00:05:49.129><c> the</c><00:05:49.279><c> same</c><00:05:49.460><c> logic</c><00:05:49.639><c> that</c><00:05:49.939><c> we</c>

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 align:start position:0%
we if we follow the same logic that we
 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.429 align:start position:0%
we if we follow the same logic that we
had<00:05:50.180><c> before</c><00:05:50.539><c> and</c><00:05:51.289><c> we</c><00:05:52.069><c> have</c><00:05:52.250><c> the</c><00:05:52.729><c> the</c><00:05:53.439><c> the</c>

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 align:start position:0%
had before and we have the the the
 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
had before and we have the the the
rotational<00:05:55.099><c> velocity</c><00:05:55.759><c> Omega</c><00:05:56.180><c> times</c><00:05:57.050><c> the</c>

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 align:start position:0%
rotational velocity Omega times the
 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.939 align:start position:0%
rotational velocity Omega times the
radius<00:05:57.770><c> R</c><00:05:58.509><c> then</c><00:05:59.509><c> that's</c><00:05:59.990><c> going</c><00:06:00.349><c> to</c><00:06:00.469><c> make</c><00:06:00.649><c> this</c>

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 align:start position:0%
radius R then that's going to make this
 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.510 align:start position:0%
radius R then that's going to make this
go<00:06:01.219><c> in</c><00:06:01.460><c> this</c><00:06:01.759><c> direction</c><00:06:02.830><c> but</c><00:06:03.830><c> the</c><00:06:03.919><c> water</c><00:06:04.129><c> jet</c>

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
go in this direction but the water jet
 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.459 align:start position:0%
go in this direction but the water jet
is<00:06:04.729><c> going</c><00:06:04.939><c> to</c><00:06:05.000><c> be</c><00:06:05.060><c> coming</c><00:06:05.330><c> up</c><00:06:05.509><c> and</c><00:06:05.779><c> at</c><00:06:06.080><c> you</c><00:06:06.319><c> like</c>

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469 align:start position:0%
is going to be coming up and at you like
 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.619 align:start position:0%
is going to be coming up and at you like
this<00:06:06.649><c> so</c><00:06:06.979><c> I</c><00:06:07.009><c> would</c><00:06:07.250><c> expect</c><00:06:07.339><c> a</c><00:06:07.759><c> snapshot</c><00:06:08.060><c> oh</c><00:06:10.629><c> god</c>

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 align:start position:0%
this so I would expect a snapshot oh god
 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:15.309 align:start position:0%
this so I would expect a snapshot oh god
I<00:06:11.659><c> see</c><00:06:11.930><c> the</c><00:06:12.020><c> problem</c><00:06:12.229><c> now</c><00:06:13.599><c> so</c><00:06:14.599><c> so</c><00:06:15.080><c> when</c><00:06:15.229><c> we</c>

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
I see the problem now so so when we
 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.019 align:start position:0%
I see the problem now so so when we
start<00:06:15.620><c> it</c><00:06:15.770><c> it's</c><00:06:15.979><c> gonna</c><00:06:16.189><c> all</c><00:06:16.430><c> go</c><00:06:16.580><c> to</c><00:06:16.639><c> the</c><00:06:16.759><c> middle</c>

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:17.029 align:start position:0%
start it it's gonna all go to the middle
 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:19.149 align:start position:0%
start it it's gonna all go to the middle
but<00:06:17.240><c> as</c><00:06:17.389><c> you</c><00:06:17.569><c> start</c><00:06:17.810><c> to</c><00:06:17.930><c> accelerate</c><00:06:18.199><c> I</c><00:06:18.800><c> think</c>

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
but as you start to accelerate I think
 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.070 align:start position:0%
but as you start to accelerate I think
it's<00:06:19.370><c> going</c><00:06:19.669><c> to</c><00:06:19.879><c> the</c><00:06:20.330><c> snapshot</c><00:06:20.810><c> it's</c><00:06:20.930><c> gonna</c>

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to the snapshot it's gonna
 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.529 align:start position:0%
it's going to the snapshot it's gonna
look<00:06:21.199><c> like</c><00:06:21.259><c> it's</c><00:06:21.500><c> lagging</c><00:06:21.740><c> behind</c><00:06:22.060><c> and</c><00:06:23.060><c> then</c>

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 align:start position:0%
look like it's lagging behind and then
 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.059 align:start position:0%
look like it's lagging behind and then
as<00:06:23.659><c> we</c><00:06:23.779><c> get</c><00:06:23.870><c> faster</c><00:06:24.289><c> and</c><00:06:24.379><c> faster</c><00:06:24.529><c> it's</c><00:06:24.949><c> gonna</c>

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 align:start position:0%
as we get faster and faster it's gonna
 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.159 align:start position:0%
as we get faster and faster it's gonna
look<00:06:25.279><c> like</c><00:06:25.430><c> it's</c><00:06:25.639><c> going</c><00:06:25.939><c> forward</c><00:06:26.300><c> okay</c><00:06:26.810><c> that's</c>

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 align:start position:0%
look like it's going forward okay that's
 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:27.670 align:start position:0%
look like it's going forward okay that's
interesting

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
interesting
 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.740 align:start position:0%
interesting
so<00:06:28.129><c> it's</c><00:06:28.759><c> something</c><00:06:29.000><c> there's</c><00:06:29.240><c> a</c><00:06:29.330><c> certain</c>

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 align:start position:0%
so it's something there's a certain
 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.949 align:start position:0%
so it's something there's a certain
speed<00:06:30.080><c> you</c><00:06:30.289><c> think</c><00:06:30.500><c> where</c><00:06:30.769><c> speed</c><00:06:31.729><c> of</c><00:06:31.819><c> rotation</c>

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:31.959 align:start position:0%
speed you think where speed of rotation
 

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:34.330 align:start position:0%
speed you think where speed of rotation
where<00:06:32.959><c> it's</c><00:06:33.649><c> going</c><00:06:33.830><c> to</c><00:06:33.889><c> come</c><00:06:34.069><c> back</c>

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 align:start position:0%
where it's going to come back
 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.379 align:start position:0%
where it's going to come back
in<00:06:34.400><c> the</c><00:06:34.460><c> middle</c><00:06:34.699><c> we're</c><00:06:34.940><c> talking</c><00:06:35.150><c> about</c><00:06:35.240><c> the</c>

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 align:start position:0%
in the middle we're talking about the
 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.350 align:start position:0%
in the middle we're talking about the
snapshot<00:06:35.900><c> yeah</c><00:06:36.290><c> yeah</c><00:06:36.740><c> I</c><00:06:37.070><c> think</c><00:06:38.060><c> that's</c>

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
snapshot yeah yeah I think that's
 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
snapshot yeah yeah I think that's
possible<00:06:38.570><c> okay</c>

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 align:start position:0%
possible okay
 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.790 align:start position:0%
possible okay
yeah<00:06:39.740><c> but</c><00:06:40.550><c> what</c><00:06:41.090><c> I</c><00:06:41.120><c> like</c><00:06:41.419><c> is</c><00:06:41.449><c> and</c><00:06:41.960><c> what</c><00:06:42.590><c> most</c>

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
yeah but what I like is and what most
 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.670 align:start position:0%
yeah but what I like is and what most
people's<00:06:43.190><c> intuition</c><00:06:43.729><c> is</c><00:06:43.900><c> you</c><00:06:44.900><c> would</c><00:06:45.020><c> expect</c>

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
people's intuition is you would expect
 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.460 align:start position:0%
people's intuition is you would expect
it<00:06:45.860><c> to</c><00:06:45.889><c> lag</c><00:06:46.310><c> behind</c><00:06:46.669><c> right</c><00:06:47.180><c> why</c><00:06:48.020><c> say</c><00:06:48.199><c> it</c><00:06:48.229><c> I</c>

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 align:start position:0%
it to lag behind right why say it I
 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.780 align:start position:0%
it to lag behind right why say it I
think<00:06:48.710><c> it's</c><00:06:48.800><c> gonna</c><00:06:48.919><c> start</c><00:06:49.250><c> lagging</c><00:06:49.669><c> behind</c>

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 align:start position:0%
think it's gonna start lagging behind
 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.879 align:start position:0%
think it's gonna start lagging behind
first<00:06:50.570><c> snapshot</c><00:06:50.960><c> and</c><00:06:51.169><c> then</c><00:06:51.290><c> it'll</c><00:06:51.470><c> speed</c><00:06:51.710><c> back</c>

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 align:start position:0%
first snapshot and then it'll speed back
 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.050 align:start position:0%
first snapshot and then it'll speed back
okay<00:06:52.220><c> well</c><00:06:52.400><c> let's</c><00:06:52.520><c> find</c><00:06:52.669><c> out</c>
