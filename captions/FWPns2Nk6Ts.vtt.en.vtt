00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.033
- Aah!

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.770
So it's tech news you want?

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.800
Well, my isolation beard
and I are happy to oblige,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.430
aren't you Francis?

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.090
Microsoft has taken the
wraps off of a plethora

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.750
of new surface devices.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.830
The Surface Book 3 uses
the same basic hardware

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.350
as the Surface Book 2 with
a 13 and 15 inch version.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.230
But it's now powered
by Intel 10th Gen CPUs

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.950
and NVIDIA 16 series
GPUs and starts at 15.99.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.370
The Surface Go 2 also shares
the original's basic design

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.580
but has a 10.5 inch
screen with thinner bezels

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.630
replacing the original 10 inch one.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.330
It's also got brand spanking new,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.930
blazing fast, Pentium Gold

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.120
and Core m3 processor options
starting at just 3.99.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.290
But weirdly the products
that might just be

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.500
the most exciting are the
new Surface Headphones 2

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.200
and Surface Earbuds.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.260
The headphones now come in matte black

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.140
with improved battery life and
Bluetooth 5.0 for 250 bucks.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.370
While the Earbuds go for 1.99
with 24 hours of battery life

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.560
and fancy new touch controls.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.410
You can even advance
PowerPoint slides with them.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.890
Get excited gamers!

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.940
Facebook is busy working on a new version

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.360
of the wildly popular
Oculus Quest VR Headset.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.940
Multiple iterations of the
product are in development

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.230
but some key targets for it's design

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.940
reportedly include a smaller form factor.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.773
Yes!

00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:25.100
Faster refresh rate, double yes!

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.430
And new controllers, nah, the
controllers were all right.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.780
Rather than a straight up sequel,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.340
this headset might be
a supplementary entry

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
into the company's VR lineup,
something like a Quest S.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.290
Oculus was originally planning

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.980
on releasing the device this year,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.590
but it looks like the impact of COVID-19,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.120
may delay its launch to 2021.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.260
The original Oculus Quest
has been selling out

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.270
virtually every time it gets restocked.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.870
So this new headset
can't come soon enough.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.610
Although there is no guarantee

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.740
that it will make me look any cooler

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.710
when I'm playing Beat Saber,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.660
to anyone who's watching
in the real world.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.640
In other Facebook news,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.480
the company is taking another swing

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.020
at providing basic internet
to the developing world.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.930
The Discover app will
provide users with free

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.740
low bandwidth data to load website text

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.140
while avoiding more
resource intensive elements

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.980
like video and audio.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.530
The app is launching
it's first trial in Peru

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.580
with further expansion
planned in Thailand,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.560
the Philippines and Iraq.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.420
Facebook tried something similar to this

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.770
in its Free Basics program in India

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.640
before the country banned it in 2016

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.950
for violating its net neutrality rules.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.150
Maybe Facebook can convince
these other countries

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.040
that it just wants to
provide free internet

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.550
out of the goodness of its heart

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.050
and not because it feeds on people's data

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.030
like Sarlacc feeds on Boba Fett.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.880
Boba Fett, excuse me, sorry (coughs).

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.430
Now it's time for the back crack

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.020
brought to you by Brilliant.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.780
Whether you're a student
looking to get ahead,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.250
a professional brushing
up on cutting edge topics,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.910
or some other category of
potentially really smart person.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.110
You should check out Brilliant's

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.470
thought-provoking math, science

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.970
and computer science content.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.170
They help guide you to mastery
by breaking complex concepts

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.740
into bite sized chunks.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.190
Check out the mathematical
fundamentals course

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.860
which introduces the foundational
ideas of number theory,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.420
logic, and algebra through
creative challenges.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.820
The first 200 of you who go
to Brilliant.org/TechLinked

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.000
will get 20% off on annual
premium subscription.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.650
So click the link below to check it out.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.500
The back cracks, I hear
them everywhere, everywhere!

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.700
Lenovo is planning to release
a pretty BA gaming phone

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.040
and we know that because it leaked.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.680
According to XDA Developers,
the Legion Gaming Phone

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.590
has a 144 hertz display, 90 watt charging

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.500
and a pop-up camera on its side.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.830
So that it will be at the top,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.560
when you're playing
games in landscape mode

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.530
and you wanna like stream or whatever.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.290
The rear camera module is also
in the middle of its back,

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.970
for some reason and it looks weird,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.810
and for that reason I want it,

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.960
actually I don't but look cool.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.130
Volvo says it's building cars
with built-in LIDAR sensors

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.030
for mass production.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.340
Thanks to its partner company Luminar,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.850
which can produce LIDAR modules

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.740
for less than a thousand bucks.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.160
They normally cost around 70,000,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.470
which is why they haven't been plumped

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.350
into every consumer vehicle
up until this point.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.990
Is Volvo about to overtake Tesla

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.800
in self-driving capability?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.460
I guess Elon has been too
busy coming up with confusing

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.880
baby names to address this threat.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.150
But he'll get back to it soon enough.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.810
Valorant's annoying
anti-cheat program, Vanguard,

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.352
has been bricking some
player's mice and keyboards.

00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:29.850
(exclaims) more good news.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.120
If reports on Reddit
are anything to go by,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.870
it appears that Vanguard is
using its kernel-level access

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.830
to disable mouse and
keyboard control software,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.450
because it thinks those
apps are for cheating.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.860
Which I guess is fair enough.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.400
But what's also fair, is me just deciding

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.020
not to play Valorant anymore.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.980
Checkmate.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.000
And Microsoft is basically
begging to be hacked.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.910
No, but really.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.960
The company has launched
a Bug Bounty Program,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.220
inviting hackers to
break into the company's

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.050
custom Linux OS called Azure Sphere.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.410
Discovery of a dangerous
exploit could net you $100,000.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.910
It's kinda like the hacky
equivalent of Morpheus doing that,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.130
like a, you know, by beckon thing.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.070
And finally NASA is working
with Tom Cruise of all people,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.840
in an effort to shoot a movie on board

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.440
The International Space Station.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.070
The first time a fictional film

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.750
would actually be shot in space.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.090
Actually, that makes perfect sense,

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.470
'cause he's just kind of
crazy enough to do it.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.550
I don't know if there's even
an idea for the movie yet.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.060
It might just be Tom Cruise
flying around the ISS,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.810
yelling about how he does his own stunts,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.300
but (laughs) I'd pay to
see that, wouldn't you?

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.900
All right that's enough
tech news for today.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.563
Come back on Friday for more tech news.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.970
For now Francis and I need to get back

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.140
to our daily nap and snuggle session.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.040
That was tiring, wasn't it little guy?
