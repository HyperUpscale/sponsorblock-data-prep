00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
it off we can actually turn

so<00:17:40.960><c> the</c><00:17:41.039><c> big</c><00:17:41.280><c> question</c><00:17:41.600><c> is</c><00:17:42.080><c> can</c><00:17:42.320><c> you</c><00:17:42.480><c> take</c><00:17:42.799><c> a</c>

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
so the big question is can you take a
 

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.110 align:start position:0%
so the big question is can you take a
mouse<00:17:43.600><c> way</c><00:17:43.840><c> back</c><00:17:44.080><c> the</c><00:17:44.240><c> whole</c><00:17:44.480><c> body</c>

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
mouse way back the whole body
 

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.350 align:start position:0%
mouse way back the whole body
and<00:17:45.360><c> be</c><00:17:45.520><c> totally</c><00:17:45.919><c> young</c><00:17:46.160><c> again</c><00:17:46.720><c> maybe</c><00:17:47.039><c> back</c>

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
and be totally young again maybe back
 

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.830 align:start position:0%
and be totally young again maybe back
from<00:17:47.840><c> two</c><00:17:48.000><c> years</c><00:17:48.320><c> back</c><00:17:48.559><c> to</c><00:17:48.799><c> two</c><00:17:48.960><c> months</c>

from two years back to two months
 

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.750 align:start position:0%

and<00:17:49.919><c> that's</c><00:17:50.160><c> what</c><00:17:50.240><c> we're</c><00:17:50.400><c> doing</c><00:17:50.640><c> right</c><00:17:50.799><c> now</c>

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%

it's it's freakishly exciting actually i
 

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
it's it's freakishly exciting actually i
thought<00:17:56.559><c> we'd</c><00:17:56.720><c> just</c><00:17:56.880><c> slow</c><00:17:57.120><c> down</c><00:17:57.360><c> aging</c><00:17:57.679><c> now</c>

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know what we've only reset the age
 

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.190 align:start position:0%
you know what we've only reset the age

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
but how many times can we do this maybe
 

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:07.669 align:start position:0%
but how many times can we do this maybe
it's<00:18:05.280><c> twice</c><00:18:06.160><c> maybe</c><00:18:06.400><c> it's</c><00:18:06.559><c> a</c><00:18:06.640><c> hundred</c><00:18:06.960><c> times</c>

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's twice maybe it's a hundred times
 

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:09.750 align:start position:0%
it's twice maybe it's a hundred times
