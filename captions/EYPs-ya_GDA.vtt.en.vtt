The first 200 to use the link in the description

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.420
Elizabeth Warren wants to break up Amazon,
Facebook, Google, and Apple.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.840
The argument goes, roughly, like this: Tech
companies have gotten really big, really fast.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.490
And they’ve abused that power by favoring
their own products over their competitors.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.339
Therefore, once a company reaches a certain
size, it shouldn’t be allowed to own both

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.070
the products and the platform on which they’re
sold.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.860
In English, Amazon can’t sell the Kindle
on its own website, and Apple has to pick

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.070
between owning Music and iMovie and News or
the App Store itself.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.610
Now, whether Warren is 100% serious or mostly
just generating publicity for her presidential

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.300
campaign, she isn’t alone.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.690
This is only the latest part of a much bigger
movement.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.329
We’re at an inflection point in history,
where new, fast, Silicon Valley is crashing

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.120
in to slow, old, government.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.950
Everywhere, all at once, the power and influence
of big tech companies are being questioned:

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.950
Google was recently fined $1.7 billion in
Europe for being anticompetitive.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.650
Sprint is trying to merge with T-Mobile, despite
significant push back.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.980
Facebook has, well, continued to be Facebook.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.440
And Spotify has launched an all-out attack
against Apple for what it claims is unfair

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.440
treatment.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.220
So, who’s right - Apple or Spotify?

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.190
Google, or the EU?

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.050
Facebook, or, literally everyone else?

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.200
First, we need to understand why these companies
have such a huge advantage.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.510
And how, in just a few years, Amazon went
from being synonymous with “cheap, convenient

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.720
shopping”, to a scary, political, nebulous
Walmart-like mega-corporation.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.900
Let’s say you wanna start a grocery store.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.460
Maybe you know a little bit about merchandising.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.510
Maybe you come from a long line of grocers
so selling produce is just in your blood.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.500
The other kids were playing with fire trucks
and trains but you, you were daydreaming about

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.660
the retail implications of The Engel Curve.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.420
Anyway, the bad news is that the grocery business
sucks.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.590
Like, famously so.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.820
If you’re lucky, you might manage a profit
margin of 3%.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.560
Unless you have some revolutionary way of
arranging bananas on the shelf, you’re just

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.740
one of a thousand stores, which customers
have no special loyalty towards.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.610
You don’t see a lot of “Proud mother of
a Safeway shopper” bumper stickers.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.570
But - there is money to be made at the very,
very top.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.220
If you can become a Kroger, or a Whole Foods,
or Trader Joe’s, well, that’s a different

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.220
story.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.531
The trick is surviving long enough that you
sell lots of things, so you can, (a), turn

00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:59.420
around to the companies making those things
and say “Hey, we’d like to buy 3,000 stores

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.270
worth of your bananas, can you make us a deal?”,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.740
and, (b), cut out the middle man by creating
your own generic brand.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.010
With size comes leverage, which lets you buy
cheaper, and, ultimately, make more money.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.430
But, again, the problem is getting there.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.340
Competing with established companies in any
industry usually means losing a lot of money

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.069
for a long time with only the hope of making
it back in the future.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.550
But don’t give up on your dream quite yet.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.220
Here’s an idea: Forget groceries for now,
let’s just find some way of making money.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.710
Like, I don’t know, selling cloud storage
to enterprise customers!

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.350
It’s a good business, no one else is doing
it very well, and, in a few years, you’ll

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.790
have so much money, you can come back to your
dream of starting a grocery store.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.670
What does cloud storage have to do with selling
grapes?

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.040
Is that really the most exciting thing you
could be doing?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.810
Pretty much nothing and probably not.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.300
But who cares!

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.910
Money is money, and as long as it makes more
than the grocery store loses, you can afford

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.500
to slowly grow it into an empire, even while
it isn’t yet profitable.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.900
This, if you haven’t noticed, is my very
crude way of describing Amazon.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.510
It started as a book company, but Bezos had
no special love for books.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.030
That was always just a good way of generating
capital for his real dream.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.100
Today, books are a footnote.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.630
The new distraction is called Amazon Web Services
- AWS.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.230
If you’re already familiar, bear with me
for a sec.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.410
A few videos back I said: &gt; A thousand downloads
don’t cost any more than one.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.780
Scale is (nearly) unlimited.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.070
My point was: it’s a whole lot easier to
sell a thousand note-taking apps than it is

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.930
a thousand actual notebooks because software
is made of bits, and bits don’t cost money.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.810
Which, is mostly true in that context, but,
not totally accurate in practice.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.880
Consider the scale at which some companies
operate:

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.130
Out of all the bandwidth, from every phone
and every computer, in every country, 15%

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.139
is just people watching Netflix.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.630
15%!

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.250
Even Uber, which, in theory just connects
the nearest driver to the nearest rider, stores

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.610
over 100 petabytes of data - or 100,000,000
GB.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.150
It also fluctuates dramatically.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.430
Every startup dreams of hitting the front
page of Reddit, Unless you’re the engineer,

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.660
in which case you have a heart attack trying
to keep up with such a huge spike in views.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.650
Companies, and, especially, startups with
limited budgets, have a tough choice:

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.530
Either buy too much capacity, Or save money
and hope they don’t get too popular.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.010
At least, until AWS.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.000
Amazon realized it could solve this problem
with a service: Only pay for what you actually

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.050
use.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.310
If your business suddenly explodes in popularity,
no problem, just pay a little more.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.139
Turn the handle for more data, as you would
water or electricity.

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.150
Amazon takes care of the rest, the same way
we outsource building windmills to electric

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.150
companies.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.000
Now, if we look at its total revenue, and
then divide it by source, it’s pretty much

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.180
what you’d expect: Amazon is mostly an online
store and you’re probably wondering why

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.980
we’re talking so much about AWS.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.190
But what about its income?

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.770
Where is it actually making a profit?

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.290
This is where it gets interesting.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.979
Now, Amazon looks like a cloud storage company
with an online retail business on the side.

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:31.720
In the 4th quarter of 2018, AWS accounted
for 58% of the company’s operating income.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.970
It alone made more money than McDonalds.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.560
So, yeah, it sells lots of USB cables and
bananas, but that’s not where the money

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.560
is.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.210
AWS is camouflage.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.240
It makes the company look good overall and
conceals how much money it loses.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.160
One business subsidizes another.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.280
And this is where it gets tricky.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.950
Because, if you’re one of the other grocery
stores, you’re thinking “This isn’t

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.840
really fair - how can we compete with someone
who doesn’t even need to make a profit?”

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.990
Safeway and Publix don’t have a $25 billion
a year cloud storage businesses.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.090
When they sell bananas, they have to, like,
ya know, make money.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.930
This is how, one after another, Amazon enters
and dominates a new industry.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.130
It plays by a fundamentally different set
of rules.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.900
Turns out it’s a whole lot easier when you’re
not super worried about the whole profit thing.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.580
Of course, predatory pricing, when a company
lowers its prices to starve out the competition,

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.370
isn’t a new idea.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.960
But once they’ve done so, companies usually
raise their prices again - that’s the whole

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960
point.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.170
Amazon, on the other hand, has always kept
its prices low.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.370
It’s not playing the long game, it’s playing
the looooong game.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.400
Here’s it’s revenue, and here’s it’s
profit.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.710
The company touches more money than ever - it
just doesn’t keep it.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.000
Profit has stayed around 0 because it’s
more interested in growth.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.480
That’s the loophole.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.650
In this essay, researcher Lina Khan explains
how, since the ‘70s, antitrust law has used

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.840
short-term prices to determine whether a company
is being anticompetitive.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.160
In other words, sure, Amazon is big, it’s
dominant, and it’s killing lots of competitors.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.270
But it’s prices are low, so it flies under
the radar.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.140
You might be thinking - so what?

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.810
If a company uses its size to save you and
me money, isn’t that a good thing?

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.610
But when products are subsidized, either by
another profitable business like AWS, or,

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.410
Venture Capitalists burning money for the
sake of growth, they don’t have to compete

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.900
on their own.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.651
Products win not because they’re the best
but because they’re funded by someone, or

00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:32.740
something, unrelated.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.399
For example, on iPhone, Apple has the Platform
Advantage.

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:40.529
It controls which apps are allowed on the
App Store, and doesn’t have to give up 30%

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:44.129
of its revenue or follow the same rules, as
everyone else.

00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:48.540
If you’re Clash of Clans, this may seem
like a relatively small price to pay for access

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.129
to 1.3 billion users.

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:54.300
For someone like Spotify, it’s a very different
story.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.069
Music streaming is the digital equivalent
of a grocery store - Spotify has such tiny

00:08:59.069 --> 00:09:03.329
margins that giving Apple 30% breaks the entire
business model.

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:07.800
And even if Apple didn’t make a dime from
its Music or News apps, it might still offer

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.509
them just to attract users to the iPhone.

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:14.420
Spotify needs to make money, but Apple Music
just doesn’t.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.290
Apple’s apps, therefore, almost certainly
have more users than they “should”.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:24.170
Which is not saying they’re good or bad,
but that some number of people, maybe 1, maybe

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:29.019
1 million, use the service only because Apple
had an unfair advantage in putting it in front

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:30.019
of them.

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:33.869
Likewise, Amazon has the Platform Advantage
on its website.

00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:38.360
At some point it realized, hey, wait a second,
if we have all the data, and we control what

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.720
people see, why on earth are we sending customers
to someone else’s product?

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.630
So now it competes with its own sellers, on
everything from batteries to backpacks and

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.630
keyboards.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.779
But wait, how is that different than any other
generic brand?

00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:56.720
Target has Up&amp;Up, and Walmart, Great Value,
but no one’s complaining they have an unfair

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.779
advantage.

00:09:57.779 --> 00:09:58.939
The difference is lock-in.

00:09:58.939 --> 00:10:03.999
It’s much easier to switch grocery stores
than it is between iPhone and Android.

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:08.620
Companies like Facebook will always say “Look,
you chose to use our service, you chose to

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.629
give us your information, didn’t you quit
your job, become a lawyer and read our 3,000-page

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:14.869
terms of service?”

00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:16.860
But that’s not really true.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.489
We made one, unrelated choice, like buying
an iPhone or Android, which required that

00:10:21.489 --> 00:10:23.910
we make a bunch of other choices later on.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.600
Nobody knows what they’re getting into.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.179
And this will only happen more as companies
get even bigger.

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:35.269
Amazon is an extreme example because AWS is
really profitable and groceries are really

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:40.399
not, but entering new categories with the
resources you already have is kind of what

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.079
a company is.

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:46.579
You might start by making smartphones but
then use that money to sell refrigerators.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:50.720
Fast-forward a few years and now you sell
life insurance and container ships.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.050
Samsung is less a brand and more a Buy-N-Large,
E-Corp conglomerate.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.879
Like Amazon, it barely makes sense to think
of it as a single, unified company.

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:03.449
One division sells parts for the iPhone.

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:07.069
Another fiercely competes against that very
same device.

00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:09.239
Even Apple is moving in this direction.

00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:13.519
It may not be in the business of refrigerators,
but you now buy your iPhone with an Apple

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:18.980
credit card, download Apple apps, back them
up on Apple’s cloud, and watch Apple-branded

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.559
TV-shows.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:23.649
But there’s also a benefit to this integration.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:28.009
One of the bests feature of the iPhone is
that it’s all designed by one company, as

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:29.920
one, coherent product.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.019
Because Apple owns both Music and iOS, they’re
easier to use, more convenient, and more powerful

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:37.149
together.

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:41.579
And because you have no choice but to use
Apple’s App Store, your phone is more secure

00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:43.379
and your data more private.

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:45.920
Now, of course, you may disagree.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.560
For some, having more freedom might be worth
the trade-off for privacy and security.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.209
But that doesn’t diminish its value for
the rest of us.

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:57.250
In other words, breaking up some of these
companies would actually mean a worse experience

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.470
for you and me.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.699
And if your “consumer protection” proposal
makes our lives worse, it’s probably a bad

00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:04.699
one.

00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:09.329
The EU has shown - time and time and time
again - that governments can make technology

00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:13.529
worse simply because they don’t understand
it - even with the best intentions.

00:12:13.529 --> 00:12:15.420
So, what’s the solution?

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.000
I don’t know.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.230
If anything, we’ve learned you should be
skeptical of any simple solution to a problem

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.230
this big.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.839
Instead, here are some ideas:

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:28.660
First, we need to expand the scope of what
qualifies as anticompetitive behavior.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.709
Low prices don’t mean the customer isn’t
being harmed.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:36.389
On the other hand, closed, locked-down markets
like the App Store aren’t necessarily always

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:37.389
a bad thing.

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:40.949
Second, we need to reexamine some mergers
and acquisitions.

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:45.600
It happens all the time: An exciting young
startup gains some traction only to just be

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.029
bought by a Google or an Amazon.

00:12:48.029 --> 00:12:50.259
Sometimes we never heard from it again.

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:55.300
Founders are incentivized to sell their companies
- to the tune of billions of dollars.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.860
But society at large would be better off with
more competition.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.421
The key is balancing the benefit we all get
from the scale of companies like Amazon, with

00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:07.689
the drawbacks of their immense political and
economic power.

00:13:07.689 --> 00:13:12.100
Many of these ideas to break-up tech companies
are designed only to get headlines.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.139
But a real solution requires a deeper, mathematical
understanding of the problem, of the type

00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:19.480
you can learn on Brilliant.org.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.600
Their pitch is simple: Sure, you can spend
hours reading textbooks, but that’s not

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.959
how most of us learn.

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:27.990
We need examples, challenges, and pictures.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.360
Their courses on Science, Math, and Computer
Science are interactive and you can do the

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.790
problems a few minutes at a time.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.070
Even if you’re just waiting in line, you
can quickly do one of their Daily Challenges.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:43.160
I just had to take a 17-hour flight, so I
was glad to see you can now download courses

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.749
to use offline.
