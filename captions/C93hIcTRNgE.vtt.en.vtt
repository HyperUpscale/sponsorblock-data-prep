00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 align:start position:0%
were cheating at major tournaments like
 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.820 align:start position:0%
were cheating at major tournaments like
like<00:04:24.090><c> Genesis</c><00:04:24.750><c> Evo's</c><00:04:25.229><c> you</c><00:04:25.409><c> know</c><00:04:25.529><c> are</c><00:04:25.650><c> things</c>

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 align:start position:0%
like Genesis Evo's you know are things
 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.420 align:start position:0%
like Genesis Evo's you know are things
like<00:04:25.950><c> that</c><00:04:26.099><c> so</c><00:04:26.219><c> that's</c>

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 align:start position:0%
like that so that's
 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
like that so that's
or<00:04:26.550><c> the</c><00:04:26.699><c> the</c><00:04:27.120><c> lime</c><00:04:27.360><c> got</c><00:04:27.690><c> kind</c><00:04:27.900><c> of</c><00:04:27.990><c> muddled</c><00:04:28.350><c> a</c>

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 align:start position:0%
or the the lime got kind of muddled a
 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.570 align:start position:0%
or the the lime got kind of muddled a
little<00:04:28.650><c> bit</c><00:04:28.740><c> so</c><00:04:28.949><c> there's</c><00:04:29.130><c> actually</c><00:04:29.220><c> a</c><00:04:29.460><c> couple</c>

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
little bit so there's actually a couple
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
little bit so there's actually a couple
examples<00:04:30.270><c> that</c><00:04:30.810><c> people</c><00:04:30.870><c> showed</c><00:04:31.320><c> off</c><00:04:31.530><c> of</c><00:04:31.710><c> him</c>

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
examples that people showed off of him
 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.520 align:start position:0%

cheating<00:04:32.850><c> that</c><00:04:33.630><c> were</c><00:04:33.690><c> actually</c><00:04:34.110><c> really</c>

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 align:start position:0%
cheating that were actually really
 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.430 align:start position:0%
cheating that were actually really
interesting<00:04:35.009><c> so</c><00:04:35.520><c> for</c><00:04:36.000><c> example</c><00:04:36.600><c> here's</c><00:04:37.199><c> the</c>

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.230 align:start position:0%
basically have like 20 people stay in
 

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.510 align:start position:0%
basically have like 20 people stay in
one<00:11:55.410><c> room</c><00:11:55.440><c> then</c><00:11:55.830><c> they</c><00:11:56.070><c> didn't</c><00:11:56.280><c> sell</c><00:11:56.490><c> enough</c>

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:56.520 align:start position:0%

of<00:11:59.370><c> the</c><00:11:59.490><c> hotel</c><00:11:59.850><c> so</c><00:12:00.150><c> then</c><00:12:00.300><c> Planck</c><00:12:00.600><c> ended</c><00:12:01.020><c> up</c>

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
of the hotel so then Planck ended up
 

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.230 align:start position:0%
of the hotel so then Planck ended up
having<00:12:01.560><c> like</c><00:12:01.680><c> a</c><00:12:01.740><c> 40</c><00:12:02.160><c> or</c><00:12:02.310><c> some</c><00:12:02.520><c> insane</c><00:12:03.000><c> amount</c>

that he disappeared recently though he
 

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
that he disappeared recently though he

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.330 align:start position:0%
actually came back into the scene he
 

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
actually came back into the scene he
actually<00:12:21.600><c> paid</c><00:12:21.810><c> out</c><00:12:21.960><c> everybody</c><00:12:22.440><c> he</c><00:12:22.620><c> owed</c><00:12:22.830><c> and</c>

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.130 align:start position:0%
actually paid out everybody he owed and
 

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
actually paid out everybody he owed and
then<00:12:23.700><c> the</c><00:12:23.940><c> pound</c><00:12:24.210><c> Sirius</c><00:12:24.660><c> was</c><00:12:24.750><c> actually</c>

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.170 align:start position:0%
then the pound Sirius was actually
 

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.100 align:start position:0%
then the pound Sirius was actually
bought<00:12:25.410><c> out</c><00:12:26.000><c> from</c><00:12:27.000><c> BG</c><00:12:27.240><c> bucum</c><00:12:27.570><c> I</c><00:12:27.660><c> believe</c><00:12:27.930><c> so</c>

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.110 align:start position:0%
bought out from BG bucum I believe so
 

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.330 align:start position:0%
bought out from BG bucum I believe so
like<00:12:28.290><c> Planck</c><00:12:28.530><c> doesn't</c><00:12:28.800><c> even</c><00:12:28.890><c> run</c><00:12:29.070><c> town</c>

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
like Planck doesn't even run town
 

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
like Planck doesn't even run town
anymore

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:29.730 align:start position:0%
anymore
 

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.640 align:start position:0%
anymore
so<00:12:29.970><c> pound</c><00:12:30.660><c> is</c><00:12:30.810><c> actually</c><00:12:31.110><c> a</c><00:12:31.170><c> legit</c><00:12:31.500><c> her</c>

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:31.650 align:start position:0%
so pound is actually a legit her
 

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
so pound is actually a legit her

player camera so basically what happened
 

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.790 align:start position:0%

is that the gene intent on the moon used
to<00:13:25.920><c> play</c><00:13:26.070><c> the</c><00:13:26.190><c> same</c><00:13:26.370><c> character</c><00:13:26.580><c> so</c><00:13:26.850><c> that</c><00:13:26.940><c> what</c>

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.030 align:start position:0%
to play the same character so that what
 

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.490 align:start position:0%

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
play Fox and Mars so what they would do
 

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.990 align:start position:0%
play Fox and Mars so what they would do
is<00:13:28.740><c> that</c><00:13:28.800><c> there</c><00:13:29.010><c> was</c><00:13:29.100><c> switch</c><00:13:29.430><c> controllers</c>

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
is that there was switch controllers
 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.490 align:start position:0%
is that there was switch controllers
between<00:13:30.420><c> them</c><00:13:30.600><c> they</c><00:13:30.930><c> were</c><00:13:31.020><c> basically</c><00:13:31.380><c> playing</c>

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
between them they were basically playing
 

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.020 align:start position:0%
between them they were basically playing
the<00:13:31.920><c> other</c><00:13:32.010><c> person's</c><00:13:32.430><c> character</c><00:13:32.640><c> so</c><00:13:32.910><c> they</c>

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.030 align:start position:0%
the other person's character so they
 

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.130 align:start position:0%
the other person's character so they

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
could basically switch characters
 

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.590 align:start position:0%
could basically switch characters
between<00:13:34.590><c> a</c><00:13:35.040><c> match</c><00:13:35.520><c> or</c><00:13:35.790><c> like</c><00:13:36.000><c> for</c><00:13:36.180><c> example</c><00:13:36.270><c> if</c>

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
between a match or like for example if
 

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.060 align:start position:0%

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.070 align:start position:0%
it came down to one be one scenario and
 

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.260 align:start position:0%
it came down to one be one scenario and
one<00:13:38.160><c> of</c><00:13:38.250><c> them</c><00:13:38.340><c> was</c><00:13:38.460><c> more</c><00:13:38.580><c> comfortable</c><00:13:38.820><c> against</c>

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:39.270 align:start position:0%
one of them was more comfortable against
 

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
one of them was more comfortable against
another<00:13:39.420><c> another</c><00:13:39.810><c> matchup</c><00:13:40.050><c> then</c><00:13:40.620><c> they</c><00:13:40.740><c> could</c>

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:40.890 align:start position:0%
another another matchup then they could
 

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
another another matchup then they could
switch<00:13:41.100><c> off</c><00:13:41.310><c> so</c><00:13:41.490><c> that</c><00:13:41.520><c> was</c><00:13:41.670><c> actually</c><00:13:41.760><c> called</c><00:13:42.120><c> a</c>

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:42.210 align:start position:0%
switch off so that was actually called a
 

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.820 align:start position:0%
switch off so that was actually called a
