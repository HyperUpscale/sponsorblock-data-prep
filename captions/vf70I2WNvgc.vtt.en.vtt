00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.190 align:start position:0%
fire but this is obviously real looking
at<00:01:55.840><c> the</c><00:01:55.920><c> scale</c><00:01:56.240><c> of</c><00:01:56.320><c> the</c><00:01:56.399><c> fire</c><00:01:56.799><c> i</c><00:01:56.960><c> would</c><00:01:57.040><c> say</c>

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
at the scale of the fire i would say
 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.030 align:start position:0%
at the scale of the fire i would say
that's<00:01:57.360><c> miniatures</c><00:01:58.000><c> i</c><00:01:58.079><c> think</c><00:01:58.240><c> you're</c><00:01:58.479><c> right</c>

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's miniatures i think you're right
 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.190 align:start position:0%
that's miniatures i think you're right
so<00:01:59.360><c> are</c><00:01:59.520><c> we</c><00:01:59.680><c> talking</c><00:02:00.079><c> about</c><00:02:00.399><c> like</c><00:02:00.719><c> a</c><00:02:00.799><c> robot</c>

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:start position:0%

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
controlled flame thrower i think they
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.510 align:start position:0%
controlled flame thrower i think they
probably<00:02:03.439><c> just</c><00:02:03.840><c> flamed</c><00:02:04.399><c> this</c><00:02:04.719><c> shot</c><00:02:04.960><c> for</c><00:02:05.119><c> real</c>

probably just flamed this shot for real
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.789 align:start position:0%
probably just flamed this shot for real

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
weight you see the impact and strength
 

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.829 align:start position:0%

that's<00:10:22.560><c> required</c><00:10:23.200><c> if</c><00:10:23.279><c> a</c><00:10:23.360><c> guy</c><00:10:23.519><c> was</c><00:10:23.680><c> like</c>

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
that's required if a guy was like
 

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
that's required if a guy was like

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
he's connecting with it yeah that's
 

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.670 align:start position:0%
he's connecting with it yeah that's
obviously<00:10:31.920><c> a</c><00:10:32.079><c> ton</c><00:10:32.240><c> of</c><00:10:32.320><c> work</c><00:10:32.800><c> and</c><00:10:32.959><c> also</c><00:10:33.440><c> i</c><00:10:33.519><c> don't</c>

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
see that kick there where she went into
 

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.949 align:start position:0%
see that kick there where she went into

the the actual motion of it and then
 

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.069 align:start position:0%
the the actual motion of it and then
they<00:11:16.560><c> filmed</c><00:11:16.880><c> a</c><00:11:17.040><c> separate</c><00:11:17.360><c> plate</c><00:11:17.760><c> with</c><00:11:17.920><c> her</c>

they filmed a separate plate with her
 

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:19.750 align:start position:0%
they filmed a separate plate with her
knot<00:11:18.320><c> in</c><00:11:18.399><c> it</c><00:11:18.560><c> of</c><00:11:18.640><c> him</c><00:11:18.800><c> just</c><00:11:18.959><c> kind</c><00:11:19.120><c> of</c><00:11:19.200><c> reacting</c>

and<00:11:19.839><c> then</c><00:11:20.000><c> they</c><00:11:20.240><c> add</c><00:11:20.480><c> all</c><00:11:20.640><c> the</c><00:11:20.880><c> visual</c><00:11:21.279><c> effects</c>

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then they add all the visual effects
 

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.269 align:start position:0%
and then they add all the visual effects
with<00:11:21.839><c> the</c><00:11:21.920><c> digi</c><00:11:22.240><c> double</c><00:11:22.560><c> and</c><00:11:22.640><c> then</c><00:11:22.800><c> composite</c>
