based on the size of the disk drive and
those<00:02:00.799><c> guesses</c><00:02:01.280><c> peg</c><00:02:01.600><c> it</c><00:02:01.840><c> as</c><00:02:02.560><c> basically</c><00:02:02.960><c> the</c>

those guesses peg it as basically the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
biggest console ever it's really tall so
 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.990 align:start position:0%

then<00:02:06.079><c> naturally</c><00:02:06.560><c> question</c><00:02:06.880><c> number</c><00:02:07.119><c> two</c><00:02:07.759><c> is</c>

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
then naturally question number two is
 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.790 align:start position:0%
then naturally question number two is
can<00:02:08.239><c> it</c><00:02:08.319><c> go</c><00:02:08.640><c> sideways</c><00:02:09.520><c> and</c><00:02:09.679><c> yes</c><00:02:10.080><c> officially</c><00:02:10.640><c> it</c>

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
can it go sideways and yes officially it
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
can it go sideways and yes officially it
can<00:02:11.039><c> go</c><00:02:11.280><c> sideways</c><00:02:12.080><c> and</c><00:02:12.480><c> this</c><00:02:12.720><c> is</c><00:02:12.879><c> the</c><00:02:12.959><c> only</c><00:02:13.200><c> way</c>

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
can go sideways and this is the only way
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.670 align:start position:0%
can go sideways and this is the only way
it'll<00:02:13.680><c> fit</c><00:02:14.080><c> under</c><00:02:14.400><c> my</c><00:02:14.640><c> tv</c><00:02:15.040><c> but</c><00:02:15.200><c> then</c><00:02:15.360><c> just</c>

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
it'll fit under my tv but then just
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.670 align:start position:0%
it'll fit under my tv but then just
subjectively<00:02:16.720><c> i</c><00:02:16.800><c> think</c><00:02:16.959><c> it</c><00:02:17.120><c> kind</c><00:02:17.280><c> of</c><00:02:17.360><c> looks</c>

from some alien planet or whatever but
they<00:02:26.800><c> really</c><00:02:27.120><c> leaned</c><00:02:27.440><c> into</c><00:02:27.680><c> this</c><00:02:27.840><c> aesthetic</c>

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
