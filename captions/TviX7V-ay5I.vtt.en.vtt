00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 align:start position:0%
they made a ball of this wire and then
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.289 align:start position:0%
they made a ball of this wire and then
thumped<00:01:17.790><c> it</c><00:01:17.939><c> with</c><00:01:18.180><c> a</c><00:01:18.210><c> hammer</c><00:01:18.509><c> you</c><00:01:20.060><c> know</c><00:01:21.060><c> Neil</c>

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.590 align:start position:0%
thumped it with a hammer you know Neil
has<00:01:21.630><c> a</c><00:01:21.659><c> big</c><00:01:21.960><c> selection</c><00:01:22.380><c> of</c><00:01:22.740><c> hammers</c><00:01:23.130><c> and</c>

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
has a big selection of hammers and
 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.310 align:start position:0%
has a big selection of hammers and
produced<00:01:24.600><c> quite</c><00:01:25.290><c> a</c><00:01:25.320><c> nice</c><00:01:25.680><c> flat</c><00:01:26.100><c> sheet</c><00:01:26.490><c> these</c>

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
produced quite a nice flat sheet these
 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.399 align:start position:0%
produced quite a nice flat sheet these
pieces<00:01:28.320><c> of</c><00:01:28.470><c> wire</c><00:01:28.670><c> essentially</c><00:01:29.780><c> cold</c><00:01:30.780><c> molded</c>

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 align:start position:0%
pieces of wire essentially cold molded
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.859 align:start position:0%
pieces of wire essentially cold molded
together<00:01:31.619><c> and</c><00:01:32.250><c> as</c><00:01:32.729><c> soon</c><00:01:32.939><c> as</c><00:01:33.060><c> I</c><00:01:33.180><c> saw</c><00:01:33.450><c> the</c><00:01:33.509><c> sheet</c>

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 align:start position:0%
together and as soon as I saw the sheet
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.899 align:start position:0%
together and as soon as I saw the sheet
I<00:01:34.140><c> thought</c><00:01:34.770><c> we</c><00:01:35.040><c> should</c><00:01:35.100><c> try</c><00:01:35.400><c> and</c><00:01:35.579><c> make</c><00:01:35.729><c> an</c>

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 align:start position:0%
I thought we should try and make an
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.999 align:start position:0%
I thought we should try and make an
impression<00:01:36.329><c> of</c><00:01:36.689><c> a</c><00:01:36.780><c> coin</c>

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.170 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:01:41.009><c> I</c><00:01:41.070><c> produced</c><00:01:41.610><c> a</c><00:01:42.530><c> British</c><00:01:43.530><c> 20</c><00:01:44.520><c> pence</c><00:01:44.790><c> piece</c>

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
so I produced a British 20 pence piece
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
so I produced a British 20 pence piece
which<00:01:45.810><c> has</c><00:01:45.840><c> a</c><00:01:46.079><c> nice</c><00:01:46.409><c> picture</c><00:01:47.159><c> of</c><00:01:47.189><c> Her</c><00:01:47.579><c> Majesty</c>

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 align:start position:0%
which has a nice picture of Her Majesty
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
which has a nice picture of Her Majesty
the<00:01:48.149><c> Queen</c><00:01:48.570><c> and</c><00:01:48.869><c> put</c><00:01:49.439><c> it</c><00:01:49.619><c> on</c><00:01:49.829><c> the</c><00:01:50.009><c> indium</c>

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.050 align:start position:0%
 
and<00:01:53.780><c> Neil</c><00:01:54.780><c> hit</c><00:01:55.680><c> it</c><00:01:55.860><c> with</c><00:01:56.100><c> a</c><00:01:56.130><c> hammer</c>

of course he hit the side with not the
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.370 align:start position:0%
of course he hit the side with not the
Queen's<00:02:03.220><c> picture</c><00:02:03.760><c> on</c><00:02:03.880><c> it</c><00:02:04.090><c> out</c><00:02:04.360><c> of</c><00:02:04.540><c> respect</c><00:02:05.020><c> and</c>

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
Queen's picture on it out of respect and
we<00:02:06.340><c> got</c><00:02:06.610><c> a</c><00:02:06.850><c> very</c><00:02:07.360><c> nice</c><00:02:07.630><c> impression</c><00:02:07.960><c> of</c><00:02:08.649><c> the</c>

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 align:start position:0%
we got a very nice impression of the
 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
we got a very nice impression of the

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
but they had to heat the Indian pretty
hard<00:06:43.210><c> and</c><00:06:43.630><c> then</c><00:06:44.140><c> the</c><00:06:44.290><c> color</c><00:06:44.560><c> appeared</c><00:06:45.100><c> I</c><00:06:45.430><c> think</c>

the<00:06:46.120><c> reason</c><00:06:46.510><c> is</c><00:06:46.750><c> that</c><00:06:46.930><c> the</c><00:06:47.740><c> color</c><00:06:48.460><c> comes</c><00:06:49.390><c> from</c>

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 align:start position:0%
the reason is that the color comes from

the reason is that the color comes from
