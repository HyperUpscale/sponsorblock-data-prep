Hi, this is David from MinuteEarth.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.440
Suppose you’re a mad scientist and - like
any good supervillain - you want to take over

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.980
the world with an army of cloned supersoldiers.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.790
Welp, waaay before you have to tackle all
the ethical and economic and infrastructural

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.710
problems that come with leading a clone army,
you’re gonna run into a major science problem.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.330
Because of the way DNA works, it’s super-hard
to make even one clone, and it’s almost

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.220
impossible to make a clone army.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.869
The idea behind making a clone is simple:
rather than the birds and the bees method

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.830
of mixing a sperm cell’s half set of DNA
with an egg cell’s half set of DNA to form

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.950
a fertilized egg, also called a zygote, you
instead take a full set of DNA from another

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.810
body cell, and use it to replace the DNA of
an egg cell in order to form a clone zygote.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.460
Because the clone zygote contains a full set
of DNA just like the regular zygote does,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.960
you might expect it to DIVIDE AND turn into
an embryo just like a regular zygote does

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.180
too... but - most of the time - it won’t.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.330
Cloned zygotes are not reliable because while
all other cells in the body do contain a full

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.470
set of DNA, these other cells optimize their
DNA to best serve their own particular functions.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.170
The cells stick little “do not use” tags
on certain unnecessary genes or otherwise

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.030
tangle them up into out-of-the-way balls.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.690
This specialization makes DNA from non-sex
cells particularly unsuited for cloning purposes

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.040
because those tags and tangles make it hard
for the clone zygote to divide.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.250
And while there ARE enzymes that de-tag and
de-tangle the DNA from sperm and eggs to enable

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.190
the good old-fashioned making of babies, when
they try to de-tag and de-tangle DNA from

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.670
another cell in a clone zygote, they do a
pretty haphazard job.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.170
As a result, almost every time a zygote tries
to divide,the process malfunctions.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.909
Every once in a great while, though, the tags
and tangles left behind for some reason don’t

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.520
stop the embryo from growing; Hello, Dolly
… or hello, supersoldier clone.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.010
But that’s just one extra supersoldier;
if you really want to ramp up your clone army

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.190
production - especially if your original supersoldier
dies of old age as you make failed clone after

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.490
failed clone - you’ll need to figure out
how to make a clone of a clone, and that’s

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.750
currently a no go.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.770
Because while your supersoldier clone may
look like your original supersoldier, its

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.990
baseline DNA already has some extra tags and
tangles, and as its cells specialize, that

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.810
tagged and tangled DNA will only get taggier
and tanglier.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.320
So when you try to clone your clone, that
DNA will be the taggiest and tangliest, which

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.979
means that the enzymes will have no hope of
untagging and untangling it.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.120
Except...some scientists - the non-mad kind
- recently identified a super-enzyme that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.060
can handle multiple generations worth of tagged
and tangled DNA which is exactly what you’d

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.361
need to make not just a clone or a clone of
a clone, but a clone of a clone of a clone

00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:26.660
of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone...whew.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.280
This technique only seems to work in certain
rodents, though, so your clone army will just

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.450
have to wait - unless, of course, your original
supersoldier is less a bounty hunter and more

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.230
a mouse-y hunter.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.920
It’s hard to clone a living thing; it’s
even harder to clone something extinct - like

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920
a mammoth!

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.200
But you can learn how scientists plan to do
it over at The Great Courses Plus, which sponsored

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.260
this video.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.340
The Great Courses Plus is like Netflix for
learning, with a library of more than 11,000

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.430
lectures, including an Introduction to Paleontology
course that details the race to reconstruct

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.069
- and clone - the mammoth genome.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.340
In addition to science content, you can check
out courses on cooking, art appreciation,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.040
and destressing your life...which sounds pretty
good right now.
