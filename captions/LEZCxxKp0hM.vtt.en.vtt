00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.450
- I saw this video on Twitter
with over 5 million views,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.540
and then again on YouTube
with nearly 1 million views.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.430
Basically, this guy
modified his cell phone case

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.670
with propellers to take
selfies, which is awesome.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.970
My only issue with it is
that it's not only fake,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.340
but it's a scam, which
I'll explain in a minute.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.360
But as for it being fake,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.280
the first clue is that
these are three-volt,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.310
seven-millimeter microbrush
motors like you see here.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.320
If you attach one to a beam like this

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.260
and turn it on at full throttle,
you'll see the most weight

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.890
that it can lift is six
quarters, or about 30 grams.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.910
The cell phone in the video

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.770
with all the flying gear
attached would weigh

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.740
about 300 grams, and since
drones are typically designed

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.480
to hover at 70% max thrust,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.940
you would need at least 15 of these motors

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.990
to do what he did.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.360
But you know, this just
doesn't look as catchy.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.880
In fact, we recreated
the exact setup he used

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.520
in the video and turned
the motors to full throttle

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.990
and this is what happened.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.180
Here it is in slow-mo, and as you can see,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.430
there's hardly any difference
than if you don't turn

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.660
the propellers on at all.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.480
So I'm gonna show you how this
scam artist somehow manages

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.430
to break the laws of
physics four more times

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.660
in this three-minute video.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.630
And then because obeying the
laws of physics isn't optional,

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.330
we're gonna call up fellow
YouTuber Captain Disillusion

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.150
to see if he can help a spot
any signs of special effects.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.880
And then with my buddy Peter Sripol,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.290
I'm gonna show you what it would take

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.350
to actually build a
flying selfie phone case,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.280
and then I'll put all the details

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.350
on a new site I built using wix.com.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.610
But before I do any of that,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.010
let me first explain why this is a scam

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.690
and not just a harmless fake video

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.340
for meaningless internet points.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.760
With this many views and an
astounding 80% like ratio,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.040
which means most people probably
didn't realize it was fake,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.750
it's a statistical certainty

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.090
that some young, aspiring engineer

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.040
actually tried to build this themselves.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.500
Worse than their parents'
phone dropping like a rock

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.330
and breaking, this might have been his

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.090
or her first experience
at making something.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.560
But how, you might ask,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.120
would they know what components to use?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.040
Well, here in the description,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.070
Amazing maker was kind
enough to put links,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.080
Amazon affiliate links.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.270
You can tell by the URLs.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.790
So he is making money off the crest dreams

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.340
of aspiring engineers
without enough experience yet

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.080
to know that this is total BS,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.930
and aspiring engineers are my people

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.578
and you don't mess with my people.

00:02:11.578 --> 00:02:12.480
(gun cocks)

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.705
Let's do this.

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:14.538
(gun fires)

00:02:14.538 --> 00:02:15.390
The second gratuitous violation

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.860
of physics comes in this scene.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.810
Force of gravity always points down,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.660
but helicopter spinning blades
create a force perpendicular

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.980
to the blades themselves.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.080
So if you want to hover,
you need to be level

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.450
so the forces will cancel
out and you won't move.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.640
If you tilt forward and
then break the thrust force

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.140
into its x and y components,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.050
you suddenly have an unbalanced
force that will move you

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.130
in that direction.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.770
In essence, that's how
helicopters move forward,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.210
by tipping forward.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.580
In other words, it's physically impossible

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.410
to hover in an orientation like this.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.210
The forward thrust
component is unbalanced,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.730
and it would have to
move the phone forward.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.600
The third major issue

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.030
is the Arduino-compatible
circuit board he chose.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.260
It's the same board here,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.270
and it's supposed to be
the brains for the drone.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.130
Yet this specific model
of board doesn't come

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.650
with any sort of gyroscope
or accelerometer.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.880
Here's why that matters.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.920
If you've ever tried balancing
something on your hand

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.230
like this, you and your body were creating

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.710
what's referred to as a closed
loop feedback control system.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.330
So if it starts to tip over,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.487
my eyes relay that to my
brain and my hand says,

00:03:12.487 --> 00:03:15.510
"Hey, I'm no longer feeling
the weight just up and down.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.730
It's also pushing my hand this way."

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.010
And so my brain takes all that information

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.740
and responds by telling
my hand to move this way

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.470
at a specific speed in
order to compensate.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.780
So to keep this thing balanced,
there's this continuous loop

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.520
of quickly gathering information,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.380
and then making real-time adjustments.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.530
And closed feedback loops are
used all over in engineering,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.030
from the simple case of a thermostat

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.190
that continuously checks the air and turns

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.800
on at a certain temperature,
to dartboards that update

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.570
their position 200 times a second

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.327
to get a bullseye every time.

00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:45.160
(bell dings)

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.620
To machines that are abused,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.230
and most certainly for
anything that flies and needs

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.250
to stay in the air.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.110
The fact that his board
is missing a gyroscope

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.350
and an accelerometer means
there's no way for it to tell

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.680
if it's starting to rotate
or to fall in any direction.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.330
It's the equivalent of
trying to balance the board

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.400
wearing a blindfold and an oven mitt.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.050
You have no idea what adjustments to make

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.363
to keep things balanced.

00:04:05.363 --> 00:04:06.196
(cat meows)

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:07.029
Which is the perfect lead-in

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.490
to the fourth major physics flaw.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.020
Notice how he attaches these motors

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.540
and rigidly fixes them to the
phone with double-stick tape.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.250
This means if you start to tip forward,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.190
you have no way to self-correct
the phone orientation,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.990
and it would just turn into a nose dive.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.330
If you only have two propellers
in this configuration,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.430
they both need to be able
to rotate with respect

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.680
to the phone in order
to correct for movements

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.090
in all six degrees of freedom.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.070
For example, if it starts to tip forward,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.410
you could rotate them both back like this

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.550
to correct for that.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.710
Or if the wind is trying
to spin the phone this way,

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.590
they could assume this
configuration to counter that.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.570
To return to our balancing shovel analogy,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.700
by fixing the motors directly to the case,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.370
you lose your ability to
even make corrections.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.740
So not only do you have
no idea where to move,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.130
but your arm is locked out from
making adjustments anyways,

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.630
which makes it literally
impossible to balance.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.897
(shovel clangs)

00:04:54.897 --> 00:04:55.800
Ow.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.540
And my final physics issue with this video

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.920
is one of acoustics.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.050
This guy proposes using
it as a hands-free way

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.840
to watch your favorite,
super hip music videos,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.437
conveniently dubbing over the audio here.

00:05:06.437 --> 00:05:07.270
(upbeat music)

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.550
(singers singing in foreign language)

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.800
For reference, this is what
an episode of "The Office"

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.400
would sound like on a
phone at full volume.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.319
(actor talking)

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.930
(propellers buzzing)

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.630
And don't forget, you would actually need

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.340
13 more motors than this,

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.590
so it would be at least six times louder.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.850
So now we've thoroughly established

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.770
a multitude of physical
laws have been broken,

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.170
let's find out exactly how he faked it.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.000
And to do that, I've arranged a video call

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.560
with the undisputed heavyweight champion

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.620
of debunking fake videos
using special effects,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.120
Captain Disillusion.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.190
- Make sure to get it as flush as possible

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.230
against your skin to minimize folds

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.477
that might make it hard to
chroma key out, like this.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:45.480
(Mark clears throat)

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.683
Nice and tight.

00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:48.510
Mmm.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.350
- Captain!

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.280
- Oh, hi, Mark.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.040
Mark Rober! You weren't
supposed to call yet.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.270
- It's two o'clock.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.730
I'm actually even five minutes late.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.850
- Really? Well then.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.080
(objects whirring)

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.250
How can I help you?

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.800
- Did you not even watch the video I sent?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.790
- Ah, yes, of course.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.290
The mobile drone video.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.420
I've analyzed it thoroughly, Mark,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.810
and my conclusion is it's totally real.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.920
- Seriously?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.630
- Yes, everything except

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.090
for the mobile drone part, that's fake.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.070
If you look very closely,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.700
you might just be able to make
out the huge, shadowing mask

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.870
on the side of the phone,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.180
visible in every shot of it flying.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.430
The creator must have been in a real hurry

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.900
because it's so messy.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.000
Here, it cuts off the edge of the phone.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.650
Here, the tip of his finger.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.330
And here, it reveals the thing

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.640
it's supposed to be hiding, a rod.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.380
It's narrow and light colored,

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.660
and probably attached with
the same mounting tape

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.850
he used to tack on all the other gadgets.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.140
That's why he's able to grab

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.210
and adjust the phone in this shot.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.820
By the river, the mask
hides not just the stick,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.500
but the whole person holding it.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.400
Look closer.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.590
On this side, the real-time water,

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.440
and on this side, a still
frame from an empty version

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.273
of the shot.

00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:01.830
And if we track the phone's
position and rotation,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.600
we can easily reverse engineer

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.790
exactly how the stick puppeteer did,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.460
rotating mostly from the
point where it was held.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.220
- Wow, that was very
impressive, Captain D.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.708
Thank you for taking the time-
- My favorite part

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:14.910
of this whole thing is the audio.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.620
The tiny propellers must have made

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.480
so little noise at a distance,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.640
it didn't give a proper drone vibe.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.910
So the hoaxers recorded the
sound of the motors up close,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.370
and reused the same clip in every scene,

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.129
complete with their muttering
voices in the background.

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:35.845
(drone whining)

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.933
- Awesome.

00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:41.370
Well, thanks again for-
- But even more impressive

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.680
is the number of posts, messages,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.720
and tweets presumably from people

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.180
with functioning eyeballs asking me

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.200
if this painfully obvious
edit is real, over and over.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.910
- Okay, Captain, well, take care.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.110
I've gotta go back to my-

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.400
- Even you, Mark!

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.930
How could you do this to me?

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:58.923
How could you do-

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.920
- He's such a joker. (laughs)

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.010
So it's fake, and now you know
exactly all the reasons why,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.510
but it's still a really interesting idea.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.970
And I was curious what it
would look like if you actually

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.490
built one of these using
less special effects

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.050
and more practical engineering.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.910
So naturally, I called
in my buddy, Peter Sripol

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.470
whose qualifications include building

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.300
his own electric plane from scratch,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.045
and he immediately got to work.

00:08:20.045 --> 00:08:22.712
(bright music)

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.190
Turns out if you take
two brushless motors,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.260
two electronic motor speed controllers,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.690
a flight controller that
actually has a gyroscope

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.460
and an accelerometer integrated,

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.150
a 3D-printed frame, and two
servos to articulate the rotors,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.280
a radio transmitter for a remote control,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.990
and a four-cell lipo battery,

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.670
and then you put them all together,

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.503
it actually works.

00:08:42.503 --> 00:08:43.336
(propeller whining)

00:08:43.336 --> 00:08:44.190
(machine clattering)

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.060
Kind of.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.530
We had to do a bunch of test flights

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.360
to calibrate that feedback control loop

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.740
we talked about before.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.050
So if we notice the drone
is either undercompensated

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.260
or overcompensating when it
starts to fall in a certain way,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.150
we tweak the response sensitivity

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.090
in between flights until
we get to the sweet spot.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.500
And I should mention,
remember how the motors

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.650
from the fake video could
barely lift only six quarters?

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.410
Well, if you properly size
them for the task at hand,

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.260
they should be able to lift 150 quarters.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.510
And so once we felt like we
had it in pretty good shape,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.275
we took her out for
the maiden test flight.

00:09:15.275 --> 00:09:17.858
(gentle music)

00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:23.316
(camera shutter snaps)

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:29.297
(camera shutter snaps)

00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:31.380
(gentle music)

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.330
In our defense, it was a
little windy out there,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.060
but as you can see, it could
be pretty wobbly at times.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.060
The truth is, a bi-copter
like this totally works.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.040
It just isn't a great design choice.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.470
The reason pretty much all
camera drones are quad-copter

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.880
is because they're much more stable due

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.790
to a larger footprint
shared between four motors.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.860
And by getting clever
with a throttle speeds,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.660
you can move in all six degrees of freedom

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.010
with no moving parts.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.570
So there you go, with solid engineering,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.390
you don't need hidden rods
or masking and rotoscoping,

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.620
and Sir Isaac Newton

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.680
can once again comfortably
rest in his grave.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.640
So the moral of the story

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.160
is just don't cheat and lie and scam.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.260
I actually considered
going a little easier

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.480
on Amazing maker, but
then I happened to scan

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.710
some of his other videos,

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.200
like this knee brace
that charges your phone

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.840
and even powers this
flashlight as you walk.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.540
In theory, I'll skip the
details, but in reality,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.550
this system would also
never work as shown,

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.950
which is why if you rewind
that and stabilize on his hand

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.223
in the pocket you see him click
a hidden flashlight switch.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.568
Thanks for watching.

00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:32.235
(bright music)

00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:36.889
(children yelling)

00:10:38.544 --> 00:10:41.627
(snowballs striking)

00:10:50.832 --> 00:10:53.580
(Mark yelps)

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.413
More tape!
