00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.440
- This is a bird feeder,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.780
and everything to my left is my attempt

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.070
at making it squirrel-proof.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.480
If they want the bird seed,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.670
they will first need to pass
through what is basically

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.460
an eight-part "Ninja Warrior"
obstacle course for squirrels.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.890
This course is extremely challenging.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.140
It is not for the timid of heart.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.980
But out of the gate,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.630
I will admit that in hindsight

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.630
that I completely
underestimated my adversary.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.800
Now if you're wondering why I would go

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.880
through all this trouble,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.740
we need to go back eight weeks ago

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.410
when I found myself stuck
at home and very bored.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.850
So I installed a bird feeder

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.280
and decided to become a birdwatcher,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.778
and it was just so lovely
(birds chirping)

00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:37.560
(record scratches)
until they showed up.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.200
Now, luckily, my bird feeder
had a wire cage around it,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.540
big enough for the birds to slip inside

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.700
but small enough to prevent the squirrels

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.630
from getting the food,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.690
and that worked really
well until right here.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.090
For me, this was like the
moment in "Jurassic Park"

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.970
when they realized the
Velociraptors can open door handles.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.530
And once the door was open,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.660
it was clear this wasn't
their first rodeo.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.300
They basically cleared this
whole tube of bird seed

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.320
by the end of the day.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.970
Mind you, this bird feeder was advertised

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.260
as being squirrel-proof.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.570
So I bought another
squirrel-proof bird feeder

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.560
to replace it.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.950
It's got this outer cage
suspended by some springs,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.690
and so if a bird comes and lands here,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.800
it doesn't weigh that much

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.630
and it has access to the seeds.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.630
However, if a squirrel comes,
they'll grab onto this cage.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.940
Its weight will force the springs down,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.550
thereby preventing access to the seeds.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.080
I have no idea

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.960
how the squirrels could
possibly outsmart this,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.830
but let's see.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.080
And this one work exactly as intended.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.490
You can see the birds love it,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.900
but when the squirrel comes along,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.190
the cage shifts down

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.710
and now all the seed ports are covered up.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.170
Every time they tried,
it was the same results.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.190
However, the next morning,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.560
this guy manages to unclip the springs

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.760
that hold the cage up,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.130
which means the cage stays
in the lowered position

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.600
where it blocks all the seed openings.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.570
Problem with that is now
they can get to the lid.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.880
But this bird feeder
lid doesn't hinge open

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.290
to give direct access,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.614
so he goes with a different tactic,

00:01:57.614 --> 00:01:59.678
(bird feeder clanking)

00:01:59.678 --> 00:02:01.080
(birds chirping)

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.840
where he now has access to
all the bird seed he wants.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.810
And so I decided I would try
one more bird feeder design.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.330
Okay. Wow.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.370
It almost feels intentional at this point.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.450
This one's supposed to work well

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.890
because it's got this baffle,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.180
which is supposed to keep the squirrels

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.430
from just coming straight
down and getting to the seeds,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.540
and more importantly,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.970
there's no way for them to rip this off.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.870
We'll see.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.630
This one debuted to similar results.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.580
As he hangs by a few toes,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.010
this is when I really started
to gain an appreciation

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.600
for what they were capable of.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.700
It definitely seemed like this bird feeder

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.540
was their favorite.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.570
Okay, yeah, they're
flexing on me for sure.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.970
And at this point, a plan
was forming in my head,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.020
but just to be thorough,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.550
I moved the post away from the fence.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.310
And I can't say I was surprised
when they just climbed it,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.680
nor was I surprised to
see they could shimmy up

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.840
and down a small metal pole

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.700
or even a large one for that matter.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.770
And whether they could climb
a certain pole material

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.650
was a moot point anyways because of this!

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.790
Look at this!

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.300
These guys are basically freaking
rodent-sized Simone Biles!

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.133
And on some level,

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:02.940
this is what it felt like
when someone stole a package

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.560
from my porch that didn't belong to them,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.180
and I harnessed that indignation,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.980
spending a year designing the
glitter bomb bait package.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.733
- Hello.

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:12.240
(glitter bomb whirring)

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.257
- [Mark] Complete with special fragrances.

00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:15.090
- Aw.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.030
- If I could design a
package to deter thieves,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.450
could I design a bird
feeder to deter squirrels?

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.520
And so after a couple
weeks of brainstorming,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.680
designing, and building
with my buddy John,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.486
we put it all together in
this 20-second build montage.

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:31.602
(upbeat music)
(tools whirring)

00:03:31.602 --> 00:03:32.515
(aerosol can hissing)

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:34.429
(metal clanking)

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.179
(drill whirring)

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.550
Here are the basic elements.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.383
For starters,

00:03:48.383 --> 00:03:50.280
here's where I've placed
their favorite bird feeder,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.780
at the end of the course.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.980
And to sweeten the deal,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.380
right below that, there's a trapdoor.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.913
And if they step here,

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.030
it releases a butt-ton of walnuts

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.310
and unfurls some celebratory banners.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.350
Why walnuts? I'm glad you asked.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.810
I'm using walnuts because
over the course of a week,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.900
I put out a buffet of seven
different nuts and seeds.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.820
And all four times I
repeated the experiment,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.010
walnuts were always
the one they ate first.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.780
What's great about placing this here

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.380
is it levels the playing
field as the birds can fly up

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.810
and get as much food as they
want anytime they need it.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.970
The squirrels, however,
will have to work for it

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.220
because the only way to
make it to this platform

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.180
is if they work their way

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.670
through my eight-part "Ninja
Warrior" obstacle course,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.140
which all starts right here.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.180
This is the only platform on the course

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.000
that has a pole that isn't
covered in slippery stuff,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.400
which means this is where
they have to climb up

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.390
to enter the course.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.920
If they try and get up any other way,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.300
they can't keep a good grip

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.470
and they just slide back down.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.080
So the first challenge is
the Bridge of Instability.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.370
Now, this may look easy,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.030
but the trick is it attaches
at a single point on each end.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.590
And from a physics standpoint,

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.970
that makes it no different

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.680
than trying to crawl across a tightrope.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.120
It's the same deceptive principle

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.340
with that one carnival
game that's so impossible.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.680
I broke it down in another
video where I use physics

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.470
to show which carnival
games were basically scams

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.970
and the science on how to beat them.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.730
Next up, the Maze of a Thousand Corridors.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.020
This one's a bit more cerebral,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.940
but if they make it through that,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.960
it will bring 'em to
the Pitchfork Tumblers,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.550
which are inspired by the show "Wipe Out."

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.930
But unlike "Wipe Out,"

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.763
I should point out

00:05:16.763 --> 00:05:19.080
that all these contraptions
are squirrel-friendly,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.030
and even with a little back force,

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.070
they will break away and stop spinning.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.940
Now, if they can make it

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.830
past the Pitchfork Tumblers of Treachery,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.810
they come to one of my personal favorites,

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.689
the Homewrecker.

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.439
(romantic music)

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.560
I put her in to tempt the
squirrel to lose focus

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.020
on the real prize at
the end of the course.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.777
Because this pad has a
pressure sensor underneath it

00:05:41.777 --> 00:05:43.680
and it connects to a microcontroller

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.660
that has a relay that
connects to a solenoid

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.070
that connects to a pneumatic piston

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.630
that connects back to this platform

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.650
with the pressure sensor,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.343
and so if they stand here
for more than three seconds,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.040
they've gotta start the
course all over again.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.410
Next up is the Slinky Bridge of Deception.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.200
I've suspended a juicy
walnut right in the middle,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.390
but there's no way this bridge
will support their weight.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.490
So it'll be interesting to
see how they approach it.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.350
The sixth challenge is
called the Tourist Trap.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.290
It's actually a bit of a
reward for making it this far.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.550
If the squirrel sticks their head

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.990
through this board my wife painted,

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.640
it's just a photo op
they can hang on the wall

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.810
of their tiny squirrel nest.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.460
I'll place a walnut here as an incentive

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.560
for them not to miss
this unique opportunity.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.700
The penultimate challenge

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.710
are the Quad Steps of Great Elevation.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.210
This is taken straight
from "Ninja Warrior,"

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.170
and this is super tricky

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.210
because these pads are all totally smooth

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.460
and placed at a 45-degree incline.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.810
And now for the last challenge.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.643
At this point,

00:06:31.643 --> 00:06:34.560
they are a near few feet away
from their ultimate goal.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.790
But if they're not careful,

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.460
they'll have to deal with
the Orbital Assist Platform,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.200
aka the Final Countdown,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.887
aka "It's not a catapult,
it's a squirrel-pult,"

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.020
which means they now have to go back

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.820
and start all the way
over from the beginning.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.350
Now, if they wanna avoid that fate,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.090
they just need to stand on this pad

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.350
for less than three seconds.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.900
But once again, I've
placed a diversion here.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.520
This one projects an optical illusion

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.470
of anything you place in
the bottom of this dish.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.700
It's actually super trippy

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.350
and looks even more
impressive in real life

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.120
because the projected image is 3D.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.710
They're like nine bucks on Amazon,

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.020
and I put a link that
explains the juicy physics

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.000
of how they work in the video description.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.620
Now with regards to squirrel safety,

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.027
I know I seem to have this reputation of

00:07:16.027 --> 00:07:17.945
(fire sizzling)

00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:19.114
(glass shattering)

00:07:19.114 --> 00:07:22.290
(people screaming)

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.210
improvised high-speed projectiles,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.790
and so this one might worry a
few animal lovers out there,

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:27.870
including my wife.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.760
We have five pets and one child,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.620
and the child was the
only one I had a say in.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.980
So rest assured, I can adjust
the pressure on the piston,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.710
and we'll be staying way
below any launch force

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.590
that could hurt any of our
adorable backyard contestants.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.750
And so, finally, after
making it through all that,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.690
we're back here at the world's
most satisfying bird feeder.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.210
And as far as I'm concerned,
if they make it here,

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.670
they've earned the right
to gorge next to the birds

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.870
for as long as they want.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.180
And so after nearly a month of prep work,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.122
the course was officially
open for business.

00:07:56.122 --> 00:07:58.440
(lighthearted music)

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.020
They could smell the walnuts
at the final station,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.850
and you could see the gears turning

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.913
because right above that was
their favorite bird feeder.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.752
And so before long, we
had our first contender.

00:08:09.752 --> 00:08:13.252
(bright electronic music)

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.990
That didn't exactly go as planned,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.910
so Rick decides to regroup.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.100
Speaking of which, that's Rick.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.870
There are a total of four competitors

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.400
that will be attempting the course.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.550
First up is Rick, and he weighs 500 grams.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.200
I know this 'cause he's actually standing

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.460
on a custom-made scale.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.800
Rick is very clever as
you'll see here in a minute,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.540
but he also gets spooked easily.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.680
Next up is Marty.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.840
He's basically
indistinguishable from Rick.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.460
Rick and Marty are inseparable

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.860
and pretty much spend all
their time together as a pair.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.240
Our third contender is Frank,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.400
also coming in around 500 grams.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.860
He's very gutsy. He's also kinda dumb.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.250
Finally, we've got my
personal favorite, Phat Gus.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.630
He's just really charming

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.700
and will strike a pose
if he sees a camera.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.590
He also really likes to eat,

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.710
and he tips the scales at
an impressive 800 grams.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.870
While most of the squirrels
are kind of particular

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.280
before making a selection

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.990
and then gracefully leaping away,

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.780
Phat Gus just goes for it, hands-free,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.970
just makes himself real comfortable.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.890
Here he is laying out with a light snack

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:23.820
from the bird feeder.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.020
I mean, you can't fault the guy

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.420
for just clearly appreciating a good meal.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.490
So now that you know our four contenders,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.870
let's get back to Rick.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.710
So he hops back on,

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.795
and he's actually doing
better than his first attempt.

00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:35.943
Mm, just barely.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.617
This is the best because he's like,

00:09:38.617 --> 00:09:40.710
"Okay, I got this. Nevermind.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.837
Well, maybe I, no, I definitely don't."

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.870
And this was the exact moment I realized

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.649
I just might be outmatched here.

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:50.316
(playful music)

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.600
Marty was watching Rick

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.730
and, after a quick dip
of his toes in the water,

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.740
adopts his strategy right out of the gate.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.160
Ooh, so close, but an excellent recovery.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.220
And Phat Gus, perhaps predictably,
comes up a little short,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.740
which brings us to the Maze
of a Thousand Corridors,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.803
which, to be honest, they
mastered this one pretty quickly.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.703
Here's a solid run from Phat Gus.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.260
And now for the Pitchfork
Tumblers of Treachery.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.320
Marty was like, "Yeah,
that's a hard pass."

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.350
Phat Gus is just like, "Abort!"

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.780
Frank is just like, "Nope."

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.349
Then he's like, "Wait a second.

00:10:29.349 --> 00:10:30.750
Mm, still nope."

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.210
Then Marty flies in real hot over the top.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.043
He didn't make it through,

00:10:34.043 --> 00:10:35.850
but that's partial credit
as far as I'm concerned.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.221
And then here's Phat Gus with
my favorite attempt by far.

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:41.804
(bright music)

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.350
And then Frank shows no fear,

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.630
which helps him pull up
this near-flawless run.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.330
And finally, Smart Rick
surgically weaves his way through

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.650
essentially untouched.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.483
And I should mention,

00:10:53.483 --> 00:10:56.040
the squirrels were most
active from 6:00 to 10:00 AM,

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.560
so every morning I've been
getting up before the sunrise

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.390
to start filming from in my house,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.880
like one of those camouflage
nature photographers,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.100
only like a suburbanized version.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.950
I've also had a handful of
streaming cameras rolling 24/7,

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.720
which has allowed me to
make such discoveries

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.450
as we have the world's worst guard dog.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.740
Thanks for the help, pal.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.270
Now back to the Homewrecker.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.610
You could see Rick is
instinctively suspicious

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.510
of this gold digger

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.550
and only for a brief
moment puts his full weight

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.383
on the platform.

00:11:21.383 --> 00:11:22.350
I told you he was smart.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.290
His buddy Marty, on the other hand...

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.633
She is a cruel mistress.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.540
And because I know my
wife is going to ask me,

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.360
no, this will not hurt the
squirrel for two reasons.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.670
Number one, they are amazing like cats

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.380
and always land on their feet.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.480
And two, they themselves were jumping

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.220
from this height all the time,

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.530
and in some cases, much higher.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.360
In fact, squirrels are
one of the few mammals

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.310
that can survive a fall from any height

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.190
because they make their
terminal velocity so low.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.300
You can see it right here.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.100
They make their body as flat as possible,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.650
then put their tail back to increase drag.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.020
They basically become their own parachute.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.160
And then right before they land,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.800
they pull in and fully
extend their arms and legs

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.840
to act as shock absorbing landing gear.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.100
This is so cool.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.933
Now back to the course

00:12:11.933 --> 00:12:15.063
where even Smart Rick
eventually lets his guard down,

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.483
which is exactly when she strikes.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.890
But just like all the
other obstacles so far,

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.140
after a day or two, they'd mastered it.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.973
In this case,

00:12:25.973 --> 00:12:28.743
even disregarding her
offering of a fresh walnut.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.580
Now onto the Slinky Bridge of Deception,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.710
and this was the sleeper
obstacle in my book.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.500
That is not a large gap,
which they can easily jump,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.320
but having the slinky there
just threw them off somehow.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.090
You can see how much
Frank is struggling here,

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.653
and he's the brave one.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.580
And Rick only jumps when Marty shows up

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.843
for emotional support.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.500
But like all the obstacles so far,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.630
after a day or two, they'd mastered it.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.450
Now onto our third to last
obstacle, the Tourist Trap,

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.430
and this one was just a freaking delight.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.866
A little peanut butter
really did the trick here.

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:02.720
(camera shutter clicks)

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.387
(playful music)

00:13:13.681 --> 00:13:14.940
Now here comes Phat Gus.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.070
And I mean, how Phat Gus is this?

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.577
He sees the camera and he's like,

00:13:18.577 --> 00:13:20.880
"Paint me like one of
your French squirrels.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.380
Yeah? No?

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.270
No takers? All right."

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.770
Here's another classic Gus

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.530
where he looks at the
camera, wait a second.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.780
Play that back,
(electronic whirring)

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.860
and freeze.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.840
Zoom, enhance.
(electronic beeping)

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.864
(record scratches)
(eerie music)

00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:39.234
(air whooshes)
(keyboard clacking)

00:13:39.234 --> 00:13:43.110
(lighthearted music)

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.190
Well, turns out Phat Gus is
not a dude and he's pregnant,

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.950
which meant I was suddenly
feeling real uncomfortable

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.510
about all those weight comments.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.420
So after a bit of a pivot
to smooth things over,

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.330
we soldiered on to the Quad
Steps of Great Elevation.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.933
Frank comes in rather
confident, almost to his demise,

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.993
but he pulls off the smooth recovery.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.720
So after not much time at all,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.950
they were looking pretty good here.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.790
In fact, one morning,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.490
I noticed Marty totally skipped
the last step altogether,

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.230
which I took as a challenge,

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.930
and so I removed the middle
step to see what they would do.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.660
And who else but Phantastic Gus?

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.253
Let's slow that down a bit.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.220
They're such amazing jumpers,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.130
so I suppose the quick mastery
here wasn't a surprise.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.620
I mean, this right here is
probably a 10-foot jump.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.290
And here's some classic
brave but dumb Frank.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.760
He'd already entered the course normally

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.370
and made it to the Homewrecker
at least a dozen times

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.203
by this point,

00:14:39.203 --> 00:14:40.036
and yet for some reason,

00:14:40.036 --> 00:14:43.140
he decides this 12-foot jump
is his best course of action.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.480
And Smart Rick was the first
one to enter the course.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.730
So in the end, after
about a week of effort,

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.050
it was fitting he was the one

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.610
to make it to the jackpot first.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.810
And he's so stoked

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.570
he apparently wants to run
the whole course in reverse.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.403
In hindsight,

00:14:55.403 --> 00:14:57.810
we probably should have made
the jackpot a little quieter.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.155
Here's Marty, as always, not far behind.

00:15:00.155 --> 00:15:02.655
(light music)

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.620
He's also a bit flighty as you know,

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.820
which worked against him here,

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.690
because down below,

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.970
Phantastic Gus, ever the opportunist,

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.940
comes through with the
real stroke of brilliance.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.627
But pretty soon, Marty comes back like,

00:15:16.627 --> 00:15:19.050
"Um, I'm the one who kinda earned that."

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.437
And then Phantastic Gus is like,

00:15:20.437 --> 00:15:22.560
"You snooze, you lose, sucker!"

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.300
And might I just say, Phantastic Gus,

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.230
when you sit like that,

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.720
you don't look an ounce over 700 grams.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.670
Eventually, they learned
that sound was a good thing

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.560
and they'd quickly return for their reward

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.600
before Phantastic Gus got any ideas.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.760
So here's a single camera
shot of a full run.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.890
And by the end, all of them
could do the full course

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.390
in less than 40 seconds.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.560
And while we're watching,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.930
you might be wondering what
happened to the squirrel-pult.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.140
Unfortunately, they didn't
really fall for my illusion much,

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.900
but I'm about to show you
the two times they did.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.980
And as a promise to my wife,

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.350
I turned the pressure
to only 40% full power,

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.090
so the acceleration
the squirrel would feel

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.320
is about half a g,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.810
which is 10 times less than
a typical rollercoaster.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.190
Additionally, I never turned on

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.920
either the Homewrecker
trapdoor or the launch platform

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.470
when I wasn't actively
watching from inside my house

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.480
where I had a manual override button,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.680
because as safe as it was,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.510
something about launching Phantastic Gus

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.440
just didn't feel right.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.780
Now what you're about to see
is gonna look pretty chaotic.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.210
But when we check the slow-mo, amazingly,

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.340
I'll show you how the squirrel is totally

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.240
in control pretty much the whole time.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.870
All right, now here's a second angle.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.290
Also, even if you don't
trust my calculations,

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.320
I can assure you that the
squirrels did not care.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.580
In both launch cases,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.700
they were back up on the
course in like five minutes.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.600
Here's the slow-mo,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.060
and see if you could spot the
two critical things he does

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.713
to make sure he lands feet down.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.850
Did you catch it?

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.890
The first critical moment is right here.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.420
He's already done the predictive math,

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.390
and he's locked his head on the
spot where he plans to land.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.650
And now his head will not lose
that lock the whole way down.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.300
What's crazy is the time it takes him

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.650
to do all the predictive math

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.060
to know exactly where he will land

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.640
and to lock his head is 300 milliseconds.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.260
That's exactly this long.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.850
Literally less than the blink of an eye.

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:07.080
That blows my mind.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:07.913
But if you think about it,

00:17:07.913 --> 00:17:09.840
it makes sense these
reactions would've evolved

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.010
to be razor-sharp

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.630
if you live your life in the trees

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.790
constantly making split-second decisions.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.920
Now, besides picking the
landing spot with his head,

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.780
the second trick is with his arms.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.910
When he wants to keep his
upper body from rotating,

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.020
he has his arms out.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.120
But the moment he wants to
rotate his upper body quickly,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.230
he tucks them in.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.910
And then when he wants to stop rotating,

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.740
he extends them out again.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.230
This is straight up conservation
of angular momentum.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.480
It's the same trick ice skaters use.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.000
Basically, bring your limbs
in if you want to rotate fast,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.340
extend them out if you
wanna slow the rotation.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.050
My buddy Destin from Smarter Every Day

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.900
also made a video analyzing
how cats always land

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.733
on their feet,

00:17:43.733 --> 00:17:45.480
and they do the exact same two tricks.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.470
The head target lock

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.300
and bringing limbs in to rotate

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.894
and out to stop rotation.

00:17:49.894 --> 00:17:52.560
(air whooshes)
Here's the second launch.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.720
So this may look like
pure luck in real time,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.730
but the slow-mo tells a different story.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.870
In that amount of time,

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.240
he's already made a slight
lateral push in that direction

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.820
and locked his landing
target with his head.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.980
We know from the previous
clip he can rotate his body

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.300
to any orientation,

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.620
but he doesn't in this case

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.020
because he sees his small
push has already aligned him

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.280
for the perfect landing.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.540
That's just so cool.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.520
And so after those two
physics demonstrations,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.370
I disabled both the Launcher
and the Homewrecker trapdoor

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.290
and just let them enjoy
the course in peace.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.180
As far as I was concerned,
they had earned it.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.740
Plus, after spending a month together,

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.240
we were sort of bros by this point.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.560
If they saw me coming out to work,

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.000
they would certainly jump away,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.980
but then they'd just
quickly be right back.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.230
And sadly, all good things
must come to an end.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.220
And because I didn't want them

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.830
to develop an unhealthy
dependence on my handouts,

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.470
after about a week of free
reign, I took down the course.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.400
But in its place,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.980
I put up a specialized
squirrel-sized picnic table.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.813
Every morning,

00:18:41.813 --> 00:18:43.800
this door opens to
release just a few walnuts

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.380
as a little treat to remind
them of our good times together.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.330
Although I had to laugh
that after all this,

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.610
somehow I didn't anticipate on day one

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.380
Frank would immediately try and figure out

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.350
and partially succeed in finding
a way to beat the system.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.360
Like everything else though,
they quickly caught on,

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.380
and now on some mornings,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.840
I'll catch them just waiting
for the daily ration,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.820
chilling patiently on the bench seat,

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.120
that is, everyone but Phantastic Gus.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.530
Don't ever change, buddy.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.540
When I started this
two-month-long adventure

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.920
trying to bird-watch,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.790
I had no idea I would enjoy
squirrel-watching so much more.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.460
It's also made me realize that
even amongst the structures

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.230
and pavement and power lines,

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.650
how interesting nature can be
in a single suburban backyard

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.180
if you just really stop to look.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.800
Even the plants are amazing!

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.570
I had no idea that as vines grow,

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.600
they spin around looking
for something to grab onto.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.090
I didn't anticipate the
wide variety of animals

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.430
that use fences as inner yard highways

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.670
to get around as a substitute
for all the trees that existed

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:39.870
before we got here.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.110
Even little interactions like
this spider extending his life

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.490
with this very timely leap

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.340
into the unknown were
just so delightful to see.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.270
But of all the animals,

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.760
I can definitively say now that squirrels

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.080
are my absolute favorite,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.120
and they're certainly a
more formidable adversary

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.650
than porch pirates.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.180
They're kind of adorable,

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.850
incredibly crafty, curious by nature,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.770
athletic, and persistent.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.200
Turns out, squirrels can
live to be 20 years old,

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.820
and so I like to think that someday,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.910
Phantastic Gus will bring his
grand-squirrels to the fence

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.120
and regale them with tales
of cowboys and courage

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.055
and legendary walnut piles.

00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:17.138
(lighthearted music)
