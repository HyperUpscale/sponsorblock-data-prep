Everybody makes mistakes, and remember, corporations
are people too, therefore they too make mistakes—Blockbuster

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.890
turned down the chance to buy Netflix, KFC
opened in China and mistranslated, “it’s

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.989
finger-licking good,” to, “eat your fingers
off,” and American Airlines, well, American

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.810
Airlines sold the infamous unlimited lifetime…

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.810
Ahye-airpass?

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810
Ah-Airpass?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.810
Ay-yerpass?

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.699
You know what, let’s just call it the airpass.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.239
See, in the 1980s, American Airlines had a
problem—they didn’t have any money.

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.690
At the time, the airline crucially needed
money as years of research, trial, and error

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.110
had concluded that the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D,
JT8D, and JT9D turbofan engines used in their

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.690
aircraft would not function without fuel…
which costs money.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.460
Now, people respond to not having money in
all kinds of different ways.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.920
Some file for bankruptcy, some steal a loaf
of bread, some start a semi-satirical educational

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.040
YouTube channel—but American Airlines decided
to respond with something truly drastic: offering

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.400
this unlimited lifetime AAirpass.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.130
The idea was simple.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.040
When the pass was first offered in 1981, it
cost $250,000, and you could spend an additional

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.310
$150,000 for a companion pass.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.160
So, if you bought both, you were looking at
a total of $400,000—with inflation, today

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.240
that would be around $1.2 million.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.660
In exchange, you got unlimited, free first-class
travel to anywhere in the world, on any American

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.170
Airlines flight, for life and with the companion
pass, you could take anyone you wanted with

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.650
you: it could be your friend, your spouse,
your friend’s spouse, a stranger, a stranger’s

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.490
spouse, a stranger’s friend’s spouse,
or Bill Clinton.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.560
28 people took American Airlines up on the
offer.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.510
Now $400,000 may sound like a lot of money—especially
for 1981—and to be fair, it was.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.132
With inflation, it’s enough to buy 138,771
Chipotle burritos with guac, or 32,875 years

00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:02.330
of CuriosityStream, or to buy just under 0.9%
of this weird drippy, swirly painting of nothing.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.500
But even though $400,000 is a lot of money,
soon American Airlines discovered that they

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.110
had made a terrible mistake in their pricing:
they had offered people far too good of a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.110
deal.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.040
See, the unlimited passes were like an all-you-can-eat
buffet.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.650
All-you-can-eat buffets make money because
even though people could eat 50 lamb chops

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.830
in one sitting, eating up all the buffet’s
money, the buffet assumes that nobody will

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.280
actually do that, because it would be… you
know… gross.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.020
American Airlines did the same thing—they
assumed people wouldn’t use the pass too

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.970
much, but they failed to consider the supertravelers:
supertravelers like this guy, Steven Rothstein,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.980
who did the flying equivalent of going to
an all-you-can-eat buffet and eating fifty

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.420
lamb chops, eighty steaks, and an entire trashcan
full of mashed potatoes.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.540
Steven Rothstein, a Chicago investment banker,
bought the unlimited Airpass in 1987.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.470
Over the next 25 years, he would use his pass
to book more than 10,000 flights.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.120
That’s an average of more than a flight
a day.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.430
He would fly to London to get lunch with a
friend or to Boston for a baseball game, then

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.780
back home for dinner.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.800
Sometimes he would fly to Providence, Rhode
Island, just to get his favorite sandwich—a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.500
bologna-and-swiss melt from a restaurant called
Geoff’s.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.819
This meant that whenever Steven Rothstein
got hungry, American Airlines had to pay hundreds

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.420
or thousands of dollars in fuel, taxes, and
other costs—not to mention lost ticket sales—to

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.480
fly him to his bologna-and-Swiss melt—which
is a lot of money, especially for a sandwich

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.599
with bologna, a meat so bad that its name
literally means nonsense.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.760
I mean come on, if you’re gonna fly across
the country, at least get salami?

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.959
And it wasn’t just Rothstein—a lot of
people used their passes much more than expected.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.640
One pass-holder, Mike Joyce, once used his
pass to fly round-trip to London 16 times—in

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.790
25 days.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.310
Keep in mind, too, that back in the 80s, when
the pass was first offered, flying cost a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.110
lot more than it does now.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.870
When you adjust for an inflation, the cost
of flying is now about 50% less than it was

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.870
in 1980.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.650
Soon, American Airlines realized they had
made a terrible mistake.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.120
They estimated that supertravelers like Rothstein
were costing them over $1 million a year,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.120
each, which made sense.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.569
By 2008, Rothstein had traveled over 10 million
miles or 16 million kilometers, enough to

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.790
go to the moon and back 20 times.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.669
Now, of course, Rothstein didn’t actually
fly to the moon; but it turns out he had flown

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.799
too close to the sun—and he was about to
get burned.

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.090
It turned out that Rothstein and others would
often use their passes to help out complete

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.719
strangers, giving them unexpected first-class
upgrades, or helping them get home when their

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:31.129
flights were cancelled.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.070
That wouldn’t normally be a problem—except
that in order to have the option to do it,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.479
the pass-holders would regularly book their
companion pass seat under a fake name, as

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.060
they didn’t yet know who might be traveling
with them—silly, made-up names like Bag

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.599
Rothstein, or Benedict Cumberbatch, you know,
names that no real human being would ever

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:46.599
have.

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.090
In 2008, American Airlines accused Rothstein
and two others of fraud, and said by booking

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.900
under false names, they had broken their contract.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.719
Security agents cornered them at airports,
revoked their passes, and told them that they

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:00.589
would never fly on American Airlines again.

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.229
Just like any red-blooded American would,
they all sued, but for Rothstein’s case,

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.219
at least, the outcome wasn’t clear as it
was settled privately out-of-court.

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.319
American Airlines stopped regularly offering
the unlimited lifetime pass in 1994, though

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:17.349
they did offer it once in 2004, for $3 million,
plus $2 million for a companion pass—for

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.710
a total of $5 million, or $6.8 million today
with inflation.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.889
That time, though, there were no takers.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.180
After all, with $5 million, you might as well
just buy your own plane—or you could buy

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.289
7% of this other painting of this drippy swirly
painting of nothing.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.939
25 people, though, still have lifetime unlimited
passes including Michael Dell, who you might

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.520
know from Dell computers, and Mark Cuban,
who you might know from Shark Tank and yelling

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.449
at referees at Dallas Mavericks games.

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.529
They can still fly anywhere, anytime, first-class
on any American Airlines flight and so long

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.849
as they don’t break the rules, they can
do it for the rest of their lives, but let’s

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.009
hope they don’t start craving too many bologna-and-swiss
sandwiches, lest they meet Steven Rothstein’s

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:55.669
same sad fate.

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.279
Who will never sell you a lifetime subscription,
panic, and then take it away from you is Audible.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.650
Don’t tell them this, though, but Audible’s,
like, a really good deal.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.840
They should probably panic.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.949
You see, with a free trial, you can get an
audiobook for $0.00.

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.419
That audiobook can be anything—even a 56
hour-long odyssey like Infinite Jest which

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.259
might not be the best choice.

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.889
I genuinely don’t know because neither I
not anyone has ever finished it —so I’ll

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.050
actually recommend The Hitchhikers Guide to
the Galaxy.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.050
It’s read by Stephen Fry and its one of
these things where there’s a reason you

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.060
keep hearing about it—because it’s fantastic.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.110
Audible is the place to get Audiobooks which,
since you can listen whenever,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.379
