now when you pay in the camera out
 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:55.379 align:start position:0%
now when you pay in the camera out
there's<00:06:54.009><c> a</c><00:06:54.069><c> drawing</c><00:06:54.369><c> from</c><00:06:54.549><c> each</c><00:06:54.789><c> part</c><00:06:55.209><c> where</c>

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:20.330 align:start position:0%
first you start with the sunset
 

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
first you start with the sunset
background<00:10:20.780><c> then</c><00:10:20.930><c> you</c><00:10:20.960><c> start</c><00:10:21.260><c> to</c><00:10:21.380><c> add</c><00:10:21.500><c> in</c><00:10:21.770><c> the</c>

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
on his head alright let's start doing
 

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
on his head alright let's start doing
some<00:10:53.120><c> zoom</c><00:10:53.360><c> outs</c><00:10:53.540><c> of</c><00:10:53.720><c> the</c><00:10:54.080><c> hub</c><00:10:54.440><c> environm</c>

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.050 align:start position:0%
some zoom outs of the hub environm
 

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.530 align:start position:0%
some zoom outs of the hub environm
now<00:10:55.410><c> there</c><00:10:55.740><c> are</c><00:10:55.920><c> three</c><00:10:56.310><c> sections</c><00:10:56.610><c> to</c><00:10:56.940><c> cuphead</c>

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
now there are three sections to cuphead
 

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.210 align:start position:0%
now there are three sections to cuphead
and<00:10:57.779><c> it</c><00:10:58.050><c> would</c><00:10:58.140><c> appear</c><00:10:58.380><c> that</c><00:10:58.410><c> the</c><00:10:58.680><c> entire</c><00:10:59.010><c> map</c>

00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
and it would appear that the entire map
 

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
and it would appear that the entire map
of<00:10:59.370><c> cuphead</c><00:10:59.790><c> is</c><00:10:59.970><c> not</c><00:11:00.149><c> loaded</c><00:11:00.510><c> all</c><00:11:00.660><c> at</c><00:11:00.810><c> once</c><00:11:01.019><c> I</c>

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:01.290 align:start position:0%
of cuphead is not loaded all at once I
 

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.500 align:start position:0%
of cuphead is not loaded all at once I
imagine<00:11:01.800><c> it</c><00:11:02.010><c> eats</c><00:11:02.220><c> up</c><00:11:02.370><c> a</c><00:11:02.580><c> lot</c><00:11:02.820><c> of</c><00:11:02.850><c> memory</c><00:11:03.300><c> to</c>

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:03.510 align:start position:0%
imagine it eats up a lot of memory to
 

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.540 align:start position:0%
imagine it eats up a lot of memory to
have<00:11:03.690><c> all</c><00:11:03.959><c> the</c><00:11:04.290><c> things</c><00:11:04.500><c> there</c><00:11:04.740><c> all</c><00:11:05.100><c> at</c><00:11:05.370><c> once</c>

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:05.550 align:start position:0%
have all the things there all at once
 

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.009 align:start position:0%
have all the things there all at once
but<00:11:05.820><c> it</c><00:11:05.970><c> is</c><00:11:06.060><c> interesting</c><00:11:06.300><c> to</c><00:11:06.540><c> note</c><00:11:06.750><c> that</c><00:11:06.779><c> when</c>

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
but it is interesting to note that when
 

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:08.900 align:start position:0%
but it is interesting to note that when
you<00:11:07.110><c> load</c><00:11:07.230><c> a</c><00:11:07.440><c> section</c><00:11:08.040><c> of</c><00:11:08.190><c> the</c><00:11:08.310><c> map</c><00:11:08.459><c> all</c><00:11:08.670><c> the</c>

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:08.910 align:start position:0%
you load a section of the map all the
