00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
so there's an X 570 variant coming out

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 align:start position:0%
commit to anything but quarter 3 is what
 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.259 align:start position:0%
commit to anything but quarter 3 is what
I've<00:02:58.440><c> been</c><00:02:58.530><c> told</c><00:02:58.709><c> most</c><00:02:58.920><c> recently</c><00:02:59.310><c> it's</c>

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 align:start position:0%
I've been told most recently it's
 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.580 align:start position:0%
I've been told most recently it's
supposed<00:03:00.510><c> to</c><00:03:00.569><c> be</c><00:03:00.690><c> a</c><00:03:00.720><c> response</c><00:03:01.080><c> to</c><00:03:01.200><c> Intel's</c>

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a response to Intel's
 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.660 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a response to Intel's
upcoming<00:03:01.980><c> stuff</c><00:03:02.220><c> for</c><00:03:02.910><c> the</c><00:03:03.709><c> well</c><00:03:04.709><c> but</c><00:03:05.100><c> the</c><00:03:05.459><c> 10</c>

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 align:start position:0%
upcoming stuff for the well but the 10
 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
upcoming stuff for the well but the 10
series<00:03:06.030><c> desktop</c><00:03:06.630><c> part</c><00:03:06.870><c> the</c><00:03:07.019><c> non</c><00:03:07.140><c> attt</c><00:03:07.530><c> parts</c>

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 align:start position:0%
series desktop part the non attt parts
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.710 align:start position:0%
series desktop part the non attt parts
so<00:03:08.310><c> I</c><00:03:08.370><c> think</c><00:03:08.940><c> if</c><00:03:09.299><c> you</c><00:03:09.420><c> think</c><00:03:09.450><c> of</c><00:03:09.630><c> it</c>

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
so I think if you think of it
 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.140 align:start position:0%
so I think if you think of it
strategically<00:03:10.170><c> and</c><00:03:10.830><c> these</c><00:03:11.040><c> probably</c><00:03:11.370><c> they're</c>

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 align:start position:0%
strategically and these probably they're
 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
strategically and these probably they're
in<00:03:12.239><c> a</c><00:03:12.299><c> position</c><00:03:12.510><c> now</c><00:03:12.870><c> where</c><00:03:12.900><c> much</c><00:03:13.350><c> like</c><00:03:13.500><c> Nvidia</c>

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 align:start position:0%
in a position now where much like Nvidia
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.830 align:start position:0%
in a position now where much like Nvidia
is<00:03:14.069><c> where</c><00:03:14.640><c> they're</c><00:03:14.910><c> they're</c><00:03:15.269><c> holding</c><00:03:15.720><c> their</c>

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
is where they're they're holding their
 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
is where they're they're holding their
own<00:03:15.870><c> without</c><00:03:16.200><c> needing</c><00:03:16.410><c> to</c><00:03:17.069><c> constantly</c>

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 align:start position:0%
own without needing to constantly
 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.490 align:start position:0%
own without needing to constantly
release<00:03:18.120><c> stuff</c><00:03:18.359><c> so</c><00:03:18.780><c> I</c><00:03:18.810><c> almost</c><00:03:19.019><c> wonder</c><00:03:19.380><c> if</c>

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
release stuff so I almost wonder if
 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.229 align:start position:0%
release stuff so I almost wonder if
Andy's<00:03:19.950><c> playing</c><00:03:20.220><c> the</c><00:03:20.310><c> game</c><00:03:20.459><c> of</c><00:03:20.489><c> you</c><00:03:21.180><c> know</c>

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
Andy's playing the game of you know
 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.300 align:start position:0%
Andy's playing the game of you know
we've<00:03:21.420><c> we've</c><00:03:21.660><c> released</c><00:03:21.959><c> pretty</c><00:03:22.170><c> well</c><00:03:22.380><c> we're</c>

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 align:start position:0%
we've we've released pretty well we're
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
we've we've released pretty well we're
doing<00:03:23.549><c> fine</c><00:03:23.730><c> with</c><00:03:23.910><c> B</c><00:03:24.000><c> for</c><00:03:24.180><c> 15</c><00:03:24.420><c> X</c><00:03:24.570><c> 570</c><00:03:25.079><c> we're</c>

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 align:start position:0%
doing fine with B for 15 X 570 we're
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.509 align:start position:0%
doing fine with B for 15 X 570 we're
moving<00:03:25.590><c> a</c><00:03:25.650><c> hell</c><00:03:25.799><c> of</c><00:03:25.829><c> a</c><00:03:25.890><c> lot</c><00:03:26.010><c> more</c><00:03:26.040><c> than</c><00:03:26.160><c> Intel</c>

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 align:start position:0%
moving a hell of a lot more than Intel
 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.759 align:start position:0%
moving a hell of a lot more than Intel
so<00:03:26.910><c> let's</c><00:03:27.090><c> just</c><00:03:27.239><c> hold</c><00:03:27.359><c> back</c><00:03:27.450><c> B</c><00:03:28.079><c> 550</c><00:03:28.530><c> until</c>

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 align:start position:0%
so let's just hold back B 550 until
 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.020 align:start position:0%
so let's just hold back B 550 until
Intel<00:03:29.040><c> has</c><00:03:29.160><c> something</c><00:03:29.459><c> to</c><00:03:29.519><c> counter</c><00:03:29.790><c> so</c><00:03:29.880><c> that's</c>

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 align:start position:0%
Intel has something to counter so that's
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.550 align:start position:0%
Intel has something to counter so that's
I<00:03:30.150><c> think</c><00:03:30.420><c> that's</c><00:03:30.570><c> the</c><00:03:30.750><c> game</c><00:03:30.930><c> he's</c><00:03:31.350><c> playing</c>

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
I think that's the game he's playing
 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
I think that's the game he's playing
right<00:03:31.739><c> now</c><00:03:31.799><c> or</c><00:03:32.790><c> to</c><00:03:32.910><c> get</c><00:03:33.090><c> getting</c><00:03:33.450><c> into</c><00:03:33.630><c> some</c><00:03:33.780><c> of</c>

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 align:start position:0%
potentially hard drives in them so this
 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
potentially hard drives in them so this
stuff<00:07:27.319><c> actually</c><00:07:27.590><c> is</c><00:07:28.490><c> going</c><00:07:28.969><c> to</c><00:07:29.090><c> do</c><00:07:29.210><c> almost</c>

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:29.449 align:start position:0%

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:31.819 align:start position:0%
literally nothing just by looking at it
 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:35.200 align:start position:0%

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.210 align:start position:0%
so that needs improvement too but this
 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.580 align:start position:0%
so that needs improvement too but this
is<00:07:35.360><c> definitely</c><00:07:35.509><c> the</c><00:07:35.750><c> cheaper</c><00:07:36.050><c> of</c><00:07:36.110><c> the</c><00:07:36.229><c> cases</c>

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590 align:start position:0%
is definitely the cheaper of the cases
 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.619 align:start position:0%
is definitely the cheaper of the cases
there's<00:07:36.710><c> no</c><00:07:36.830><c> price</c><00:07:37.129><c> yet</c><00:07:37.460><c> on</c><00:07:37.669><c> it</c><00:07:37.879><c> it's</c><00:07:38.270><c> mostly</c>
