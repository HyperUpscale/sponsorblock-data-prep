00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.390
- These massive drones
are attempting to plant

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.760
20 million trees from the sky,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.590
but to find out how I
ended up here in the middle

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.380
of this forest, we need
to go back six months

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.900
because that's when
MrBeast hit 20 million subs

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.460
and someone suggested to celebrate

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.020
he should plant 20 million trees.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.970
It went super viral on Reddit and Twitter

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.980
at which point someone else
suggested he should team up

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.080
with me and a bunch of other
YouTubers to make it happen,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.670
which got me thinking.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.380
And so with that, I made
my way to Oregon to meet

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.045
with MrBeast at his crew
to plant 20 million trees.

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:31.628
(upbeat music)

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:45.900
(all clapping)

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.900
One down; 19,999,999 more to go.

00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:51.772
(hands clap)

00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:55.272
(upbeat music continues)

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.450
- It's 20 million trees
in a 48-hour time period.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.097
- The statistics may not be
in our favor, but we got grit.

00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:05.764
(upbeat music)

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.903
Worm, worm!

00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:10.620
Abort, abort!

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.453
- [Volunteer] Save it, save it.

00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:12.840
- These guys are talking a big game

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.830
like they know what they're doing,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.910
but gonna go do a impromptu pull test.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.500
First of all, I don't love the angle.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.000
Can I just say that off the bat?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.833
- No.

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:23.257
- Oh no, oh wow!

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:25.918
(whimsical music)

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.126
- [Instructor] Okay, so this is an-

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:28.739
(bell dings)

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:30.176
Oregon White Oak.

00:01:30.176 --> 00:01:32.843
(upbeat music)

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.080
- We've been planting all day.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.400
A solid eight hours, we're
up to like 250 trees.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.770
So, I mean, it's a start.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.690
It's definitely a start.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.120
Can we just say, look who's the dirtiest.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.130
- [MrBeast] I saw you rubbing stuff on me.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.116
- Wow, yeah.
- Just look who's

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:55.890
the dirtiest.
- Yeah, come on, Mark.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.790
- Mine's super dirty.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.530
- My back kills.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.970
There's a field of trees.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.990
300.
- Yep.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.150
- After a full day of planting.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.921
300 is less than 20 million.

00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:05.754
(bell dings)

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:06.587
So after talking it over,

00:02:06.587 --> 00:02:08.460
we decided we would play to our strengths.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.900
Jimmy was gonna try and solve our problem

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.390
with a tweet recruiting
thousands of people,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.990
and I was gonna pursue
a more robotic solution.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.880
And so with that, I made
my way further up the coast

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.650
of Washington using a shortcut I knew

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.185
to see if I could uncover a way
to plant trees from the sky.

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:23.610
(lighthearted music)

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.260
But before I get into
that, have you ever thought

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.620
about where trees actually
get their mass from?

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.140
The knee-jerk reaction is to
think it comes from the soil,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.760
but that can't be true because

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.520
if you have a tree in a big
pot, as the tree gets bigger

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.680
the soil level doesn't go down at all.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.360
The answer, as it turns out,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.540
is that the mass comes from thin air.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.250
The clue is if you look at what the bulk

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.840
of the tree is actually made of.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.580
It's almost entirely carbon.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.260
Pretend I'm a tree.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.500
Basically a tree sees a
carbon dioxide molecule

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.960
floating by, then it powers up with energy

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.730
from the sun using photosynthesis.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.040
Then it uses that energy to rip the carbon

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.500
from the oxygen and it takes that carbon

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.140
and slaps it on itself to get more swole.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.760
And the tree's like, hey humans,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.970
here's some beautiful fresh
oxygen you can have back.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.960
I don't need it.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.500
So it takes the C and
leaves us with the O2.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.020
That's a sweet deal, and so
trees start really small,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.430
but in order to get bigger and bigger,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.310
they're just sucking more and
more carbon out of the air.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.110
And so now you can see
a tree and appreciate

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.610
the beauty in the shade but also that

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.100
they're just these really
massive vacuum bags

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.320
completely stuffed full of carbon.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.610
And so I was in Washington to meet

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.590
with some people who had a crazy idea

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.450
that just might be the
key to helping MrBeast

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.610
and I plant those 20
million carbon vacuums.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.960
What's up?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.100
Their company's called DroneSeed

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.510
and they're only about four years old,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.420
and their idea is to
use these massive drones

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.100
to plant trees from the sky.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.390
They do this in two steps.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.520
First, they send out a smaller recon drone

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.220
that uses lasers to create
a 3D map of the terrain,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.480
and then from that, they use software

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.670
to find all the best
spots to drop the trees

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.530
to maximize their survivability.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.700
And then they create a flight path

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.130
for each of the drones
to fly autonomously.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.510
Then you load up the drone with a bunch

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.970
of these seed pucks that
you'll drop from the sky.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.470
And their design is super clever too,

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.840
because in each puck,
represented by a hockey puck

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.000
in this case, there's a special cocktail

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.370
of around six seeds specifically chosen

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.660
for the area where they're planting.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.420
And then you have nutrients,
sort of like a fertilizer,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.730
that will help the seed grow
and keep it from drying out.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.050
And then because you don't
want a bunch of squirrels

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.660
or mice just making a buffet
out of all the seeds you drop,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.890
you need some way to condition them

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.557
to give the whole experience
just a one star review.

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:28.255
(sniffs)

00:04:28.255 --> 00:04:29.088
(groans)

00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:30.270
- So ghost peppers,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.790
they're an olfactory
and gustatory deterrent

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.940
which means if you eat it, you
know, the obvious reaction,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.286
and on the way out is the same thing.

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:40.320
- Yeah, gustatory is the
euphemism for on the way out.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.550
I ate Taco Bell last night

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.950
and had some gustatory issues as well.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.390
And then once you secure the puck dropper

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.520
to the drone, it's time to fly.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.045
Light the fires, kick the tires.

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:51.654
(drones buzzing)

00:04:51.654 --> 00:04:53.237
(futuristic hiphop music)

00:04:53.237 --> 00:04:56.520
(Mark laughs)

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.180
Dude, that's like a
mini house just flying.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.013
That is wild.

00:05:01.914 --> 00:05:04.410
(futuristic hiphop music continues)

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.103
Oh, there we go! (laughs)

00:05:07.985 --> 00:05:09.690
I don't know why it's so funny to me.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.280
It really just looks like mechanized poop.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.360
And in some ways this sort

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.190
of like mimics mother nature, right?

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.450
Because like a bird eats a
seed, it flies, it poops it,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.970
and there's like, nourishment
around that seed, right?

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.120
- Yes, that's exactly
what it is, is biomimicry.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.770
- And this is brutal terrain.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.690
You wouldn't be wanting
to walk down in here.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.950
So to be able to access this

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.170
from the sky is a really big deal.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.300
After wildfires, we used
to rely on Mother Nature

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.740
to do reforestation forest us,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.810
but due to some factors
related to climate change,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.960
40% of the time now we're
seeing tall shrubs grow back

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.120
instead of big old
trees that can literally

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.500
suck up tons of carbon.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.630
And that's an example
where drones are perfect

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.540
because they can get in right
away and start planting trees

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.030
in the smoldering remains
where it's too dangerous

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.260
for humans to be on the ground.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.630
Even with only three
drones you can reforest

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.900
an area six times faster
than a normal planting crew.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.390
If you can nail a fleet
like this with just three,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.650
you could just scale this up.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.540
You can imagine the potential where,

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.060
you know, you have a swarm of 100 drones.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.160
The work DroneSeed is doing is awesome.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.170
It gives me so much hope when I see people

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.560
use really cool technology
to solve really big problems.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.360
But they're still fine-tuning their system

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.040
before they massively scale up,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.810
so they just aren't going
to be able to help us

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.520
plant the 20 million trees in time.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.690
Which is why we've been talking

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.220
with all our YouTube creator friends

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.320
for the past five months, and we decided

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.750
if we were actually gonna
plant 20 million trees by 2020,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.670
we would need to bring the entire

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.160
YouTube community together on this.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.870
- I'm stoked, let's plant some trees.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.850
- I'm so excited.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.770
- It could be one of the craziest things

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.210
that YouTube has ever seen.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.160
Just so many people, we could
end up with too many trees.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.720
- We're calling it #TeamTrees

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.460
and we went through a
bunch of different options

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.350
on how to pull this off
and eventually settled

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.030
on working with the Arbor Day Foundation.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.990
They're the longest running,

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.330
most well-respected
tree-planting non-profit

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.500
and we made a deal with them

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.510
that for every dollar we give them,

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.100
they would plant one tree.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.390
It's basically magic

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.400
and I had to prove that
to my buddy Thomas.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.570
Here's a dollar.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.490
I'm gonna call my buddy Zach King here.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.680
- [Thomas] Zach King, oo-la-la.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.513
- Oh, hi, Mark.

00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:10.080
- [Mark] Hey Zach, we've
got a dollar for you.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.913
- Oh, okay.

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:13.232
So you're gonna take the dollar,

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.656
put it in some dirt, and then pull.

00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:15.690
(leaves rustle)
- Ooh.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.523
- And you get a tree.

00:07:16.523 --> 00:07:18.030
- Oh wow.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.960
- Pretty slick.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.450
And so despite mine and
MrBeast's best effort,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.240
we need your help, because
to plant 20 million trees,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.000
we're really looking to raise $20 million.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.550
That's just an insane goal,
especially when you only

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.290
have two short months to pull it off.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.630
But starting today, you're
gonna see the entire

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.790
YouTube community come together on this

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.712
like you've never seen before.

00:07:37.712 --> 00:07:40.290
- Okay, 20 million Trees, I am so in.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.160
- Proud members of #TeamTrees.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.770
We're filming a music video.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.790
- We all way.
- No way.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.910
- I will plant at least a couple of trees.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.320
- The reason I'm most excited about this

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.300
is it feels like the
end of "Power Rangers"

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.220
when they would all
assemble into the big thing

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.080
and fight stuff together and do good.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.420
- This will absolutely be historic

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.880
and we need you on #TeamTrees.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.040
This is our chance to end this decade

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.450
on a super strong note.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.610
It's a constructive way
to tell the policymakers

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.500
that this generation and our community

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.990
on YouTube truly cares
about the environment.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.610
It's basically all of us joining together

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.340
to give a massive fist bump
to fricking Mother Earth.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.830
I personally will be planting 50,000 trees

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.260
by donating $50,000, but that's still

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.050
way less than 20 million,
so join me and MrBeast

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.640
and all your favorite YouTube creators

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.950
by clicking that blue
button right over there

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.400
and planting as many trees
as you can afford right now.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.870
We honestly need you.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.000
If you're a working adult,
consider how many trees

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.920
you're willing to plant to send a message.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.660
If you're a kid, talk to
your parents about this.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.030
Get creative and do some
chores to earn some money.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.400
Ask for some freaking trees for Christmas.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.920
You can pick up 20 littered
soda cans and then recycle them,

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.960
and that's literally one
more tree that will exist

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.490
in the world than if you
wouldn't have done that.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.280
This is all hands on deck, so
either click that blue button

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.550
or go to teamtrees.org and
turn your dollars into trees.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.990
And then for like, the next two months,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.970
make sure you like and
double tap and retweet

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.620
anything having to do with #TeamTrees

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.600
and harass your favorite creators to join

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.460
if they somehow haven't already.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.310
And so now in exchange
for joining #TeamTrees,

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.410
if you've ever wondered how
we really know climate change

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.710
is occurring, stick
with me for two minutes,

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.720
'cause I'm gonna break it down real simple

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.280
using this column of ice.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.320
A while back scientists
went down to Antarctica

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.390
and drilled out a bunch
of ice cores like this,

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.960
and what's cool is that because
ice layers up over time,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.790
the really old ice is at the bottom

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.650
and the newer ice is on top.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.690
Now, as you know, ice traps air bubbles.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.670
So as you move your way down the column

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.470
you get these little pristine pockets

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.450
of air going back in time.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.790
What they found was that
CO2 levels in the atmosphere

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.910
naturally fluctuate from about 200 to 300.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.160
But then starting with
the Industrial Revolution,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.410
we started burning way
more coal, which is made

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.050
from dead trees, and we
started burning down forests

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.660
for resources to keep pace
with the growing population.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.520
The problem with both
of these is we're taking

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.440
all this carbon that was in the ground

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.810
in these massive carbon vacuum bags,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.760
and we're putting it back into the air

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.530
at a super unnatural rate.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.540
So much so that around 1950,

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.150
we busted into the 300s for the first time

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.620
in at least a million years.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.630
And we weren't done yet
because just four years ago

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.300
in 2015 we broke into the 400s.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.340
When I started writing
the script for this video,

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.630
we were at four 411.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.010
Today we're at 412.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.570
And this is the actual current data

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.300
from NASA's excellent website,
which does a great job

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.790
laying out all the data they've
gathered on climate change.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.350
A lot of my old friends at NASA

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.360
played a role in collecting this data.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.120
Now, here's the punchline
and why all of this matters.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.040
If you independently look
at average temperature

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.810
over the past million
years and then overlay it

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.700
with average CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.650
they match up pretty much exactly.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.470
So this relatively sudden
spike of all the CO2

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.540
in the air is not a good thing.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.820
And sure enough, right
now we are consistently

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.560
breaking the hottest
month on Earth records,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.090
which has a lot of knock-on effects,

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.100
which will start snowballing unless

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.440
we can band together
and reverse the trend.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.850
And it's important to note with regards

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.160
to #TeamTrees that 20
million trees by 2020

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.780
isn't going to cure climate change,

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.400
but it's a step in the right direction

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.830
and a constructive, positive
way to send the message

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.380
that we see the science and we care.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.940
So thanks for watching and thanks

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.860
for doing your part to make a difference.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.930
I am so stoked.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.993
We totally got this.

00:11:08.993 --> 00:11:13.993
(water rushing)
(birds chirping)

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:15.606
(glass shatters)

00:11:15.606 --> 00:11:17.827
(air whooshes)

00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:18.924
(Mark screams)

00:11:18.924 --> 00:11:21.507
(upbeat music)

00:11:22.507 --> 00:11:24.169
(snow canon fires)

00:11:24.169 --> 00:11:27.169
(deep reverb music)
