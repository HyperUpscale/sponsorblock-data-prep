bone works because I started this thing
and<00:16:26.480><c> it</c><00:16:26.660><c> was</c><00:16:26.750><c> gonna</c><00:16:26.839><c> be</c><00:16:26.930><c> a</c><00:16:27.050><c> one</c><00:16:27.290><c> off</c><00:16:27.439><c> theory</c><00:16:27.829><c> and</c>

00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:28.009 align:start position:0%
and it was gonna be a one off theory and
 

00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
and it was gonna be a one off theory and
now<00:16:28.130><c> it's</c><00:16:28.310><c> a</c><00:16:28.399><c> three</c><00:16:28.670><c> partner</c><00:16:29.060><c> so</c><00:16:29.269><c> anyway</c><00:16:29.630><c> until</c>

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:29.930 align:start position:0%
now it's a three partner so anyway until
 

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.249 align:start position:0%
now it's a three partner so anyway until
next<00:16:30.199><c> time</c><00:16:30.740><c> remember</c><00:16:31.189><c> that's</c><00:16:31.759><c> just</c><00:16:32.060><c> a</c><00:16:32.750><c> theory</c>

00:16:33.249 --> 00:16:33.259 align:start position:0%
next time remember that's just a theory
 

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:38.649 align:start position:0%
next time remember that's just a theory
up<00:16:33.790><c> but</c><00:16:34.790><c> not</c><00:16:34.970><c> really</c><00:16:35.269><c> thanks</c><00:16:35.959><c> for</c><00:16:36.170><c> watching</c>
