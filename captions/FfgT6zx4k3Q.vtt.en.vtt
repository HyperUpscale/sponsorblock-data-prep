00:00:00.608 --> 00:00:04.111
Electricity is all around us all the time.​

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:07.682
It makes our lives easier, safer, more fun,​

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:09.615
and most of us never think about it.​

00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:13.753
But is there such a thing as too much electricity?​

00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.258
Could the thing that is the foundation of the modern world​

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:19.292
slowly be killing us?​

00:00:29.403 --> 00:00:30.838
Before we dive deeper,​

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:33.574
let's try to understand what electricity is,​

00:00:33.574 --> 00:00:35.108
and how it affects us.​

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.112
Electricity is the movement of an electric charge.​

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.717
This movement generates ​​Electric​ and ​Magnetic Fields​

00:00:42.717 --> 00:00:45.551
that spread out through space and carry energy.​

00:00:45.987 --> 00:00:49.622
We call this phenomenon:​
​​​Electromagnetic Radiation​.​

00:00:50.257 --> 00:00:52.927
Radiation is a word that makes people very nervous.​

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:55.930
But, to radiate just means, "giving off".​

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.432
Like when the radiator in your house gives off heat​

00:00:58.432 --> 00:01:00.666
in the form of infrared radiation.​

00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:03.738
Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum​

00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:06.207
correspond to different types of radiation.​

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:09.175
And, many of them are perfectly harmless.​

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.811
Some of them can be dangerous though.​

00:01:12.413 --> 00:01:14.482
Radiation with very short wavelengths​

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:17.585
like UV Light, X-Rays, and Gamma Rays​

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:20.755
are strong enough to rip electrons out of their atoms,​

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:23.423
which can cause burns and genetic damage.​

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.527
This is what many people have in mind
when they hear the term "radiation".​

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:31.465
The rest of the spectrum covers
a large range of longer waves​

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.701
from Visible Light, Infrared,​

00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:36.035
Microwaves, to Radio Waves.​

00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:40.808
This is the kind of radiation that's
emitted by all sorts of human technology.​

00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:43.044
Mobile phones, Wi-Fi routers,​

00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:46.045
electric power lines, and household appliances.​

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:50.251
This radiation doesn't disrupt molecules in our body.​

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:54.488
However, some kinds of radiation
can stimulate muscles and nerves​

00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:56.991
and can also make the hair on your body vibrate,​

00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:01.294
which can sometimes cause a tingly feeling
above certain threshold values.​

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:03.729
Other kinds are useful for making dinner.​

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:07.034
Microwaves push the water molecules in your food around​

00:02:07.034 --> 00:02:08.134
which warms it up.​

00:02:08.803 --> 00:02:10.571
This happens to us all the time.​

00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:13.174
For example, the pleasant warmth you feel at the beach​

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:15.309
is your skin heating up from exposure to​

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.177
electromagnetic infrared radiation from the sun.​

00:02:18.712 --> 00:02:21.949
We are surrounded by natural, and generally harmless,​

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.819
sources of electromagnetic radiation all the time​

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.052
and always have been.​

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.689
But, since the Industrial Revolution,​

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.891
we have added a lot of it to our immediate environment.​

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.895
The question of whether this is actually dangerous​

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:38.065
first got public attention when a 1979 study​

00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:41.068
linked leukemia to living near power lines.​

00:02:41.068 --> 00:02:44.338
This particular study was quickly discredited though.​

00:02:44.338 --> 00:02:46.440
The connection could not be explained​

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.242
and no direct causal link was confirmed.​

00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:53.047
But once this had been proposed, the idea persisted.​

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:55.683
And the thousands of studies about possible dangers​

00:02:55.683 --> 00:02:58.718
illustrate that it's still seen as a very real threat.​

00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:02.022
A lot of people claim to be sensitive to the radiation​

00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:04.590
coming from our appliances and cell phones.​

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.061
They report symptoms like headaches,​

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.063
nausea, skin reactions,​

00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:10.997
burning eyes, or exhaustion.​

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:14.902
But those are just effects reported on a day-to-day basis.​

00:03:14.902 --> 00:03:18.204
A few studies have found much more unsettling results.​

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.208
Like, possible connections between the side of the brain,​

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.277
which people use when they are on their phones,​

00:03:23.277 --> 00:03:25.344
and the appearance of brain tumors.​

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.282
The question that science is trying to answer,​

00:03:28.282 --> 00:03:31.519
is not so much about the acute effects of irradiation.​

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.653
We know, for example,​

00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:35.990
that x-rays cause immediate damage to the DNA in your cells​

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.758
but that the same doesn't happen with radio waves.​

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.760
The question is rather:​

00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:45.399
Is the sort of weak electromagnetic radiation
we are constantly surrounded by​

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:50.436
harmful in the long run as a result
of some as-yet-unknown mechanism?​

00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:54.540
Answering this question was much harder than we first thought.​

00:03:54.608 --> 00:03:56.677
There are thousands of primary sources,​

00:03:56.677 --> 00:04:00.313
reports, and statements by an onslaught of different organizations.​

00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:02.516
So, we read a lot for this video.​

00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:05.418
You can take a look at our research in the video description.​

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.889
What we found is that this debate is a good example​

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.560
of how science should be communicated
and how it shouldn't.​

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.031
Many of the much-cited studies that spread panic
about electromagnetic radiation​

00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:18.731
are highly controversial.​

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:19.700
For example,​

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.103
a series of population studies based on surveys and self-reporting.​

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:26.307
What this means is, for example,​

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:30.910
asking brain tumor patients how much they think
they used their phone in the last few years.​

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.013
The problem is that people are unreliable.​

00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:37.650
We tend to misremember things or can be influenced easily.​

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:39.086
On top of this,​

00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:43.591
studies or media reports may be cherry picking
the findings that best suit their opinion​

00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:45.658
or make for the most exciting headline.​

00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:46.727
For example,​

00:04:46.727 --> 00:04:50.963
a study looking for cancer in rats and mice from cell phone radiation.​

00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:53.601
The results seemed to show a connection.​

00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:56.470
But, for some reason, only in male rats.​

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.471
And, none at all in mice.​

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.542
But it was ​​reported​ as if this study did prove​

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:04.076
that mobile phone radiation causes cancer.​

00:05:04.311 --> 00:05:09.649
Unfortunately, this is the case for studies
with both positive and negative findings on the issue.​

00:05:10.284 --> 00:05:15.356
Another aspect, is that the WHO did
officially classify radio frequency fields​

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:17.324
as possibly carcinogenic.​

00:05:17.324 --> 00:05:19.193
But what this actually means​

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:22.229
is that there are some hints that they might cause cancer,​

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.298
but we can't prove it, and that we will keep an eye out.​

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.635
So, if we zoom out a bit, what's the big picture?​

00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:30.838
On the whole,​

00:05:30.838 --> 00:05:33.574
there was no consistent evidence in human studies​

00:05:33.574 --> 00:05:38.377
that electromagnetic radiation below
exposure value limits causes health problems.​

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.181
There are some statistical associations​

00:05:41.181 --> 00:05:44.050
but they're mostly weak and inconsistent.​

00:05:44.485 --> 00:05:47.254
If there were any definite cause-effect relations​

00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:50.356
we would know by now because of all the data we have.​

00:05:50.758 --> 00:05:53.160
So, based on the current state of science,​

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.865
should you worry about the radiation
from your laptop, or cell phone, or TV?​

00:05:57.865 --> 00:05:59.700
The answer is no.​

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.800
You shouldn't.​

00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:04.270
But what about the people who say it ​​is​ harming them?​

00:06:04.672 --> 00:06:09.275
Research show they could be experiencing​
​what's known as the ​​Nocebo Effect​.​

00:06:09.843 --> 00:06:14.114
If you have a headache and happen to start
feeling better right when you switch off your laptop,​

00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:17.149
you might see a connection between those two things.​

00:06:17.584 --> 00:06:22.323
Once you get this suspicion, the idea alone
that weak radiation might harm you​

00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:24.490
could be the very thing harming you.​

00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:26.994
It's easy to belittle these people;​

00:06:26.994 --> 00:06:29.596
most of them feel they're not being taken seriously,​

00:06:29.596 --> 00:06:31.997
which makes the situation even worse for them.​

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.034
They should get support.​

00:06:34.034 --> 00:06:36.637
But, it's important to be aware that, so far,​

00:06:36.637 --> 00:06:43.109
we have no robust evidence that electricity below
safety limits has any negative effect on humans.​

00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:45.913
In the attention economy we live in,​

00:06:45.913 --> 00:06:51.617
talking about unproven dangers can make us
neglect things that we know for sure are bad for us.​

00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:53.620
Just one example:​

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.058
Outdoor air pollution is linked to
4.2 million premature deaths each year,​

00:06:58.058 --> 00:07:01.861
and is definitely something
we could have a real impact on today.​

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:05.232
Still, to make people feel safe, and just to make sure,​

00:07:05.232 --> 00:07:08.402
there are several long-term studies ongoing already.​

00:07:08.402 --> 00:07:13.374
For example, the Cosmos study that will look
at the possible health impacts of cell phone use​

00:07:13.374 --> 00:07:17.209
by exactly measuring frequency and duration of phone calls.​

00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:21.382
But while we wait for the conclusion of these long-term studies,​

00:07:21.382 --> 00:07:24.150
there are a lot more pressing problems to focus on.​
