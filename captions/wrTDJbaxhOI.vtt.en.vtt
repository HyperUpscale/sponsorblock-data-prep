00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
Fetching water for brick making

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.720
Slaking clay bank

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.860
Digging clay

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.580
Treading clay

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.680
Ceramic brick mold soaked in water (so clay won't stick)

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.540
Forming clay into mold

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.320
Turn bricks on side to dry

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.780
Brick carying harness (takes strain off back)

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.160
Dry stacking bricks under eves of hut to keep them out of rain

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.440
Making brick kiln

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.960
This is the fire box level. There are two parallel fireboxes. Both fireboxes are open at the front and back of the kiln

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.080
These bricks form the grate bars on which the wood burns.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:05.700
Grate bars allow air under the wood, increasing combustion rate several times compared to burning wood directly on the ground.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.260
This level is the area above the grate bars where the wood is placed

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.080
Finally this layer is the floor of the ware chamber where the bricks will be fired

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.520
The finished firebox

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.540
Using ordinary mud as a mortar, the first layer of the ware chamber is built

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.460
Vertical and horizontal brick joints are plastered with mud

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.460
Finished brick firing kiln

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.320
Collecting un fired bricks to take to the kiln

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.380
The kiln is about 30 meters from the hut in the clearing, near the creek

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.060
For the first layer, just turn the bricks sideways rather than burning them on a grate made of bricks (fits more in this way I decided)

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.420
Make the next layer of bricks at right angles to the first

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.860
Alternate layers in this fashion

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.020
4 layers of 10 bricks = 40 bricks per firing

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.040
Cover top with 6 bricks to help hold the heat in

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.840
Collecting firewood, thin 35-75 cm long sticks are good for this sized kiln

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.940
Better to have too much than not enough

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.940
Making fire with fire sticks, the simplest primitive method in my opinion

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.300
Transfer hot ember on leaf to tinder bundle

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.620
Ember ignites tinder

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:03.500
With wood already in the fire box, kindle a small fire underneath in the ash pit

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.800
Then transfer burning sticks to the second firebox

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.500
Load wood into the back of the kiln also so it may catch fire here too

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.320
Feed wood into the 4 entrances (2 back, 2 front), leave the space under empty so air can move under the burning wood

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.320
This kiln burns wood fast so feed wood in as fast as it consumes it

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.100
This is about 1 hour in and the bricks are already starting to glow red

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.860
Feed back and front of the kiln

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.840
Strong draft is apparent

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.560
Total firing time: 2 hours 30 minutes

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.720
This is enough so the bricks wont dissolve in water afterwards

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.760
The next day after the kiln cooled

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.740
Fired brick ready for water test

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.080
Fired brick remains intact

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.560
Un-fired brick for comparison

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.860
Un fired brick disolves

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:18.980
Conclusion: To make bricks resistant to rain and water fire them in a kiln

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.580
Unloading kiln

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.940
40 fired bricks

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.540
Brick firing kiln
