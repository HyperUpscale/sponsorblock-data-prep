00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 align:start position:0%
first let's just confirm that half life
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810 align:start position:0%
first let's just confirm that half life
3<00:00:48.420><c> is</c><00:00:48.870><c> or</c><00:00:49.110><c> is</c><00:00:49.230><c> not</c><00:00:49.260><c> coming</c><00:00:49.920><c> out</c><00:00:50.039><c> let's</c><00:00:50.280><c> do</c><00:00:50.520><c> that</c>

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
3 is or is not coming out let's do that
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
3 is or is not coming out let's do that
alright<00:00:51.090><c> so</c><00:00:51.539><c> half-life</c><00:00:52.199><c> 1</c><00:00:52.440><c> came</c><00:00:52.739><c> out</c><00:00:52.890><c> in</c><00:00:53.090><c> 1998</c>

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 align:start position:0%
alright so half-life 1 came out in 1998
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.650 align:start position:0%
alright so half-life 1 came out in 1998
and<00:00:54.360><c> then</c><00:00:54.719><c> half-life</c><00:00:55.230><c> 2</c><00:00:55.500><c> came</c><00:00:56.100><c> out</c><00:00:56.280><c> in</c><00:00:56.660><c> 2004</c>

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
and then half-life 2 came out in 2004
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
and then half-life 2 came out in 2004
and<00:00:57.930><c> then</c><00:00:58.289><c> it</c><00:00:58.620><c> took</c><00:00:58.890><c> them</c><00:00:59.160><c> three</c><00:00:59.550><c> years</c><00:00:59.579><c> to</c>

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 align:start position:0%
and then it took them three years to
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.270 align:start position:0%
and then it took them three years to
essentially<00:01:00.539><c> come</c><00:01:00.690><c> out</c><00:01:00.870><c> with</c><00:01:00.989><c> the</c><00:01:01.170><c> DLC</c><00:01:01.859><c> right</c>

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
and then they lift it with this
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.499 align:start position:0%
and then they lift it with this
cliffhanger

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.260 align:start position:0%

this so what was the story behind them I
 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.729 align:start position:0%
this so what was the story behind them I
was<00:02:47.790><c> basically</c><00:02:48.180><c> the</c><00:02:48.630><c> the</c><00:02:49.109><c> whole</c><00:02:49.320><c> this</c><00:02:49.500><c> is</c><00:02:49.620><c> the</c>

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 align:start position:0%
was basically the the whole this is the
 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.259 align:start position:0%
was basically the the whole this is the
biggest<00:02:50.070><c> leak</c><00:02:50.250><c> that</c><00:02:50.489><c> ever</c><00:02:50.640><c> happened</c><00:02:51.000><c> I</c><00:02:51.090><c> think</c>

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 align:start position:0%
biggest leak that ever happened I think
 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.849 align:start position:0%
biggest leak that ever happened I think
because<00:02:51.450><c> it's</c><00:02:51.600><c> it's</c><00:02:51.780><c> the</c><00:02:51.959><c> most</c><00:02:52.200><c> it</c><00:02:52.590><c> wasn't</c>

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
because it's it's the most it wasn't
 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.199 align:start position:0%
because it's it's the most it wasn't

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 align:start position:0%
even the biggest it was just the most
 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.150 align:start position:0%
even the biggest it was just the most

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 align:start position:0%
come out and it will that's all I'll say
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.950 align:start position:0%
