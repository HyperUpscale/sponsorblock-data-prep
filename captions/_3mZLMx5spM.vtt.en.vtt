00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.153
- Hey guy, welcome back to a channel.

00:00:02.153 --> 00:00:04.501
A few weeks ago, I turned 26.

00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:06.811
Today, I'm gonna be joining Kidz Bop,

00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:09.194
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:10.027
Hopefully.

00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:11.116
(upbeat music)

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:12.199
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.679
Why? and that's a great question.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.264
It's because Kidz Bop
has gotten out of hand.

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:20.054
They have been exploding (explosion)

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:21.984
in popularity and I don't understand it.

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:23.633
For most of my life
I've been led to believe

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.556
that the only people
who listen to Kidz Bop

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:27.584
are the children whose mother this is.

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:29.862
But no, Kidz Bop is a global empire.

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.914
Children everywhere are listening to it,

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:33.475
seemingly on purpose.

00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:38.142
Kidz Bop 40 just came out,
and there are 66 songs on it.

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:41.302
An album with 66 songs.

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:45.906
That's like watching a 12 hour movie.

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:48.396
But the reason there
are 66 songs in here is

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:50.545
because Kidz Bop is now
an international brand,

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:51.851
no longer content with simply

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.576
just ruining American pop music.

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:54.772
They now have songs in Spanish.

00:00:54.772 --> 00:00:56.044
(upbeat music in Spanish)

00:00:56.044 --> 00:00:56.877
German

00:00:56.877 --> 00:00:57.710
(soft music in German)

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.709
and listen to this.

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:01.289
(upbeat music in Korean)

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.032
that's right. They got Kidz Bop K-pop.

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:06.561
When I was a kid, we made fun of Kidz Bop

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:10.558
and now that other people are
kids, they're listening to it?

00:01:10.558 --> 00:01:11.396
And here's the thing,

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:14.974
I know I'm very passionate
about Kidz Bop, who wouldn't be?

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.330
But you're probably wondering
what's my plan here?

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.288
What am I hoping to get

00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:20.570
out of joining something
that I openly dislike?

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.682
And I'll tell you,

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:25.208
I'm gonna take down Kidz
Bop from the inside.

00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:27.072
(upbeat rock )

00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:30.972
Hopefully. First I pose as a
multi-talented child prodigy

00:01:30.972 --> 00:01:34.167
who just looks kinda
old for his age of 12.

00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:38.199
Then once I'm inside, I start
working my way up the ladder.

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:40.551
I find a way to get promoted to manager,

00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:43.982
then district manager,
then assistant manager,

00:01:43.982 --> 00:01:46.202
then president of Kidz Bop.

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:48.597
From there it's as simple
as just firing all the kids.

00:01:48.597 --> 00:01:49.930
No Kidz, no Bop.

00:01:51.147 --> 00:01:53.720
So today I will be
auditioning but before I get

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.111
to what will undoubtedly be the
biggest audition of my life,

00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:57.285
I first wanna share with you guys

00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:58.958
some of the worst atrocities that Kidz Bop

00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.881
has bestowed upon our
eardrums over the years.

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:02.439
Starting with their first album.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.116
Kidz Bop debuted in 2001, and
it was the second worst thing

00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:07.054
to happen that year.

00:02:07.054 --> 00:02:08.831
But it's weird, listening to this,

00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:12.428
you might notice one glaring
difference between these songs

00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:14.145
and every other song they've ever made.

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:16.786
Here's blink 182's All The Small Things.

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:19.369
(upbeat music)

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:33.210
♪ All the small things ♪

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.376
♪ True care ♪

00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:38.684
- It's some fucking old
guy, that's not kids.

00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:39.522
♪ Work sucks ♪

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:42.110
- This guy's older than the entire band.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.737
This guy might be 182.

00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:48.363
What happened to the whole by
kids for kids business model?

00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:51.635
This is like by weird uncle for nobody.

00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:52.649
♪ Work sucks ♪

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:53.715
- Okay. Don't worry.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.018
There are kids in this song, sort of.

00:02:56.018 --> 00:02:57.133
Let's get to the chorus.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:03:02.133
(Children and Older man singing
All The Small Things chorus)

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.814
Yeah, this is obviously a great song,

00:03:06.814 --> 00:03:09.722
but it does beg the question: huh?!

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.524
Is this what kidz bop was supposed to be?

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:15.030
The world's weirdest cover band?

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.946
It's like one adult man and four kids.

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:19.741
Na na na na na na

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.779
This theme continues on
the rest of the album.

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:22.776
We've got J. Lo,

00:03:22.776 --> 00:03:24.310
(Kidz Bop cover of J. Lo song)

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.216
the Backstreet Boys,

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:29.318
(Kidz Bop I Want it That Way cover)

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:30.358
You got Smash Mouth

00:03:30.358 --> 00:03:33.852
(Kidz Bop All Star cover)

00:03:33.852 --> 00:03:35.116
And it's the same thing every time,

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:37.327
bad adult singer accompanied by children

00:03:37.327 --> 00:03:39.202
who may or may not have been kidnapped.

00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:42.704
(Kidz Bop Fly by Sugar Ray cover)

00:03:42.704 --> 00:03:44.519
Now, this album was not sold in stores.

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.617
You could only buy it by
calling a phone number

00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:48.872
that you could only get
by watching a commercial.

00:03:48.872 --> 00:03:51.782
And as we already discussed,
it's a karaoke CD made

00:03:51.782 --> 00:03:55.043
by a bunch of amateur musicians
and three random kids.

00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:58.087
So naturally they sold 800,000 copies.

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:01.016
$21 a piece, that's a cool 17 mil,

00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:03.487
someone's production
budget just skyrocketed.

00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:05.966
So let's check out Kidz Bop two.

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:09.299
(Man singing R&amp;B cover)

00:04:11.745 --> 00:04:13.865
Man, this guy can spit some bars.

00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:18.243
♪ We're getting married, that's
my lovin', and all my huggin ♪

00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:19.090
- All my hugging.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.648
(Chorus of Kidz Bop Higher cover)

00:04:22.648 --> 00:04:26.635
I think there's fewer kids on
this album than the first one.

00:04:26.635 --> 00:04:28.761
I guess we could try Kids Bop three?

00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:33.761
(Man covering Wherever You Will Go)

00:04:33.858 --> 00:04:37.484
Okay, who is this guy?
Whose uncle is this?

00:04:37.484 --> 00:04:40.448
(Chorus of Kidz Bop
Wherever You Will Go cover)

00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:42.310
You know what this sounds like?

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.530
Have you ever been to a bar,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.495
and there's some shitty cover
band playing in the corner?

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:49.946
It sounds like if they
couldn't get a babysitter,

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:51.862
so they were just like, alright kids,

00:04:51.862 --> 00:04:53.658
guess you're coming with us.

00:04:53.658 --> 00:04:55.732
But stay in the back, alright?

00:04:55.732 --> 00:04:58.736
Oh shit they got simple
plan on here? Let's go dude.

00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:01.736
(Simple Plan cover)

00:05:03.278 --> 00:05:04.969
It's still just some guy.

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:06.523
(cover of Cry Me A River)

00:05:06.523 --> 00:05:09.676
Where are the kids? I
thought this was Kidz Bop!

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:12.506
Holy shit, Ocean Avenue?

00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:14.644
Now I don't often share
this fact with people,

00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:18.112
but Yellow Card was my favorite
band for like 10 years.

00:05:18.112 --> 00:05:19.859
So this better be good.

00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:24.276
(Poorly done cover of Ocean Avenue)

00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:29.862
When does the guy go away?

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.658
It's gotta be soon, right?

00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:33.965
(Man covering Boulevard of Broken Dreams)

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:34.798
- Nope.

00:05:34.798 --> 00:05:36.318
(Man covering Nickelback's Photograph)

00:05:36.318 --> 00:05:37.151
No.

00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:39.265
(Man covering Move Along)

00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:40.098
Still no.

00:05:40.098 --> 00:05:41.364
Forget trying to figure out

00:05:41.364 --> 00:05:43.308
when the adults stopped
being a part of this.

00:05:43.308 --> 00:05:44.759
When does this get good?

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.978
I mean like, I don't enjoy new Kidz Bop,

00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:48.252
but we can all acknowledge

00:05:48.252 --> 00:05:50.830
that there is some
competent production there.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.627
This is awful.

00:05:52.627 --> 00:05:53.460
♪ Work sucks ♪

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.854
Remember Bad Day?

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.129
The song, most people probably
know because they played it

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.656
whenever American idol
contestants got voted out?

00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:00.920
Well even if you've never heard of it,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.042
even just the title should give you a hint

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:04.893
of the tone of the song.

00:06:04.893 --> 00:06:07.398
It's about having a bad day.

00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:10.482
So let's hear the Kidz Bop rendition.

00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:13.843
- ♪ Where was the moment
we needed the most? ♪

00:06:13.843 --> 00:06:15.010
- [Kids] Yeah!

00:06:17.213 --> 00:06:20.595
You kick up the leaves
and the magic is lost.

00:06:20.595 --> 00:06:22.045
- [Kids] Whoo!

00:06:22.045 --> 00:06:23.174
- It's been such a rough week for me.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:26.070
I accidentally ran over my cat on one

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.534
of those bird scooters.

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:28.367
- Yeah!

00:06:29.807 --> 00:06:33.746
- And it sucks because I just
spent like $50 on cat food

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:34.579
- Whoo!

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:36.153
- And you said you're the only therapist

00:06:36.153 --> 00:06:37.125
my insurance covers?

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:37.958
- Yeah!

00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:42.440
- 18. That's when they finally
fired all the weird adults,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.075
and let the kids take over.

00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:45.524
I mean, it makes sense
that they would wait

00:06:45.524 --> 00:06:47.415
until they were 18 to grant
them their independence.

00:06:47.415 --> 00:06:50.323
But what doesn't make
sense is that on this album

00:06:50.323 --> 00:06:53.209
they did a cover of Justin Bieber's Baby,

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:56.905
which is a song that was
already sung by a kid,

00:06:56.905 --> 00:06:59.406
and they changed none of the lyrics.

00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:01.448
So I'm not sure how necessary this was.

00:07:01.448 --> 00:07:03.124
You know, it's a shame that
they eventually strayed away

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:04.514
from their original business model

00:07:04.514 --> 00:07:07.133
of having some weird
old guy sing the songs

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.565
because that's what I am.

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.454
But I will not let this deter me

00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:13.132
from the fact that I'm going
to be joining Kidz Bop today

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:14.824
whether they like it or not.

00:07:14.824 --> 00:07:17.518
Well, I guess they would have
to like it, I'm auditioning.

00:07:17.518 --> 00:07:19.115
Now, if you go to the kid's bop website

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:20.418
you may notice there's no link

00:07:20.418 --> 00:07:22.908
on here to submit my audition.

00:07:22.908 --> 00:07:26.932
You have to manually type
in kidzbop.com/casting.

00:07:26.932 --> 00:07:28.184
It's on this page where you can learn

00:07:28.184 --> 00:07:31.712
all about what it takes
to become a Kidz Bop kid.

00:07:31.712 --> 00:07:33.168
Wait, hold on, I think
that might actually be-

00:07:33.168 --> 00:07:34.108
(Twinkling)

00:07:34.108 --> 00:07:34.941
Huh.

00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:37.053
Now, if I'm going to successfully
pull off this experiment,

00:07:37.053 --> 00:07:39.960
I need to fully transform into a kid.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.393
You may have already noticed
I'm wearing Danny's slime shirt

00:07:42.393 --> 00:07:44.467
because kids fuckin love slime.

00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:46.929
I'm also wearing the
shortest shorts that I own

00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:49.239
because it just seemed like
something a kid would do.

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:50.072
I don't know.

00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:51.197
But I'm not going to keep the feds

00:07:51.197 --> 00:07:53.483
off my trail just by looking like a kid.

00:07:53.483 --> 00:07:55.645
I also need to sound like a kid,

00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:57.153
and that starts with my name.

00:07:57.153 --> 00:07:58.560
I can't use Drew Gooden for this

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.920
because if they look
it up my cover's blown.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.176
No, I have to come up
with a different name.

00:08:03.176 --> 00:08:04.727
That doesn't sound like my name,

00:08:04.727 --> 00:08:08.059
but also makes me sound like a kid.

00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:09.988
Perfect. With a name like that,

00:08:09.988 --> 00:08:12.015
they'll never suspect a thing.

00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:13.837
So the audition itself
is very straightforward.

00:08:13.837 --> 00:08:15.746
I sing a couple songs, do a dance

00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:17.354
that they've choreographed for me.

00:08:17.354 --> 00:08:20.261
Mm I can smell that
acceptance letter already.

00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:21.189
Let's do this

00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:23.313
- Hey Kidz Bop it's me your newest member.

00:08:23.313 --> 00:08:25.160
Just kidding, or maybe not.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.855
I've been singing and
dancing my whole life.

00:08:27.855 --> 00:08:30.320
Actually, my first
words were a whole song,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.710
and the first time I walked,
I actually, I did the moonwalk

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.162
a few things about me
that you should know.

00:08:35.162 --> 00:08:39.679
I have won awards and
I have hobbies as well,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.480
and I play sports too.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.621
Alright, I think I nailed that part.

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:43.885
The tricky portion of this

00:08:43.885 --> 00:08:45.232
is going to be the singing though.

00:08:45.232 --> 00:08:48.419
I don't have a very good singing voice.

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:49.640
(Drew imitating a Kidz Bop song)

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.041
But luckily they don't know that.

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:55.075
Yes, I think this will do nicely.

00:08:55.075 --> 00:08:58.926
This is my song, thank you for listening.

00:08:58.926 --> 00:09:03.676
(A child's voice covering Adele's Hello)

00:09:07.109 --> 00:09:08.327
The next part was also a little tricky,

00:09:08.327 --> 00:09:10.872
I had to learn a one-minute
choreographed dance

00:09:10.872 --> 00:09:12.466
and I almost gave up on this.

00:09:12.466 --> 00:09:15.152
It took me a few days,
but I finally nailed it.

00:09:15.152 --> 00:09:18.485
(upbeat Kidz Bop cover)

00:09:20.033 --> 00:09:21.562
Another minute or so freestyle dancing,

00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:22.825
that shouldn't be a problem.

00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:26.492
(Kidz Bop Photograph Cover)

00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:30.642
Hi, Hollywood? Yeah, I'll
take a one-way ticket.

00:09:30.642 --> 00:09:32.112
If your child plays an instrument,

00:09:32.112 --> 00:09:34.197
please showcase 30 seconds.

00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:36.076
Now not to brag or anything, but this part

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.344
should be a cake walk,

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:39.627
I've actually been playing
guitar for about seven years.

00:09:39.627 --> 00:09:41.260
So I don't even need to fake this

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.630
(Relaxing acoustic guitar music)

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.838
(Electric guitar shredding)

00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:49.636
(Cover of Hello by child)

00:09:49.636 --> 00:09:50.779
That was a fucking breeze,

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:53.273
now I just got to send this
off to some guy named Stuart.

00:09:53.273 --> 00:09:56.059
Stuart Stone Casting,
let's find out his deal.

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:58.763
- Hey, Will Roberts out here
in Hollywood, California.

00:09:58.763 --> 00:10:01.916
I'm actually at Stuart Stone,
he's a casting director

00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:04.821
here in Los Angeles,
California, a big one!

00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:06.169
- Doh! A big one!

00:10:06.169 --> 00:10:07.686
- Alright hey Will Roberts out here

00:10:07.686 --> 00:10:10.057
in Hollywood- eh, kinda
Hollywood, California.

00:10:10.057 --> 00:10:12.594
- Wait what? He just said a
minute ago, he said Hollywood.

00:10:12.594 --> 00:10:15.629
And now he's in kind of Hollywood.

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:19.933
I mean, technically we're
kind of near Hollywood,

00:10:19.933 --> 00:10:22.084
I mean we're in Utah, but we're close

00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:22.917
- A big one!

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:24.336
All right, this guy seems legit.

00:10:24.336 --> 00:10:26.423
There is one comment on this video,

00:10:26.423 --> 00:10:29.692
and it is Stuart Stone is
hilarious! (read sarcasm).

00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:33.700
Yeah, I wanna work with this
guy, barrel of laughs, not.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.585
I don't think he'd know
funny if he sat on it.

00:10:37.585 --> 00:10:39.127
Alright, well, if this is the guy

00:10:39.127 --> 00:10:41.172
in charge of Kidz Bop casting,

00:10:41.172 --> 00:10:44.030
then I think I might actually have a shot.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.754
So I'm going to go
ahead and send this off.

00:10:45.754 --> 00:10:47.224
It looks like the only thing
we'll have to do now is wait

00:10:47.224 --> 00:10:50.974
for that acceptance
email to come rolling in.

00:10:52.477 --> 00:10:54.894
(Rock chord)

00:10:57.909 --> 00:11:00.711
(gasp) He's probably just busy.

00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:01.979
Hey, in the meantime, I think it

00:11:01.979 --> 00:11:05.459
wouldn't be a bad idea to
go scope out my competition,

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:07.907
and I know just the place.

00:11:07.907 --> 00:11:10.796
Alright guys, we are here in
beautiful Kissimmee, Florida

00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:13.676
home of Gator land, which is like a zoo

00:11:13.676 --> 00:11:15.393
except it's all swamp animals.

00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:17.415
So we're here at Kidz Bop live,

00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:20.501
a real thing that I just
found out is real and exists.

00:11:20.501 --> 00:11:24.064
We're going to see just how
well these kids can bop.

00:11:24.064 --> 00:11:25.696
And if they can do it better
than me, which probably not

00:11:25.696 --> 00:11:28.092
because I'm really talented and
that's what we're gonna see.

00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:29.297
So let's check it out.

00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:31.841
Entering the arena, my confidence
was at an all time high.

00:11:31.841 --> 00:11:34.458
These kids didn't stand a chance.

00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:36.322
Little did they know they
were about to take part

00:11:36.322 --> 00:11:39.142
in the biggest performance
review of their life.

00:11:39.142 --> 00:11:40.132
I actually did a little research

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:41.768
before the show, get a load of this kid.

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:44.962
He says his dream is to play
professional basketball.

00:11:44.962 --> 00:11:48.053
Well, sorry to break it to you, Stephen,

00:11:48.053 --> 00:11:51.416
But last time I checked, they
don't let 11 year olds play

00:11:51.416 --> 00:11:53.964
in the NBA. What an idiot.

00:11:53.964 --> 00:11:56.449
Meet the other kids? I don't want to.

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:58.669
Anyway, back to this snooze Fest.

00:11:58.669 --> 00:12:01.582
Wait, are they playing Thank You, Next?

00:12:01.582 --> 00:12:02.624
I love this song. It's kind of like I'm

00:12:02.624 --> 00:12:04.109
at an Ariana Grande concert right now

00:12:04.109 --> 00:12:05.471
but for half the price.

00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:07.500
Oh wow, they're they're
really good dancers.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.618
That one's playing the guitar?

00:12:08.618 --> 00:12:12.116
That's pretty cool. Or
I mean, dumb, obviously.

00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:14.703
These kids suck, but, shit
they're really working

00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:17.402
that stage, they're naturals.

00:12:17.402 --> 00:12:18.235
What the hell?

00:12:18.235 --> 00:12:20.362
I didn't think these kids
would actually have talent.

00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:22.844
I can't compete with this. I'm old.

00:12:22.844 --> 00:12:24.703
And I thought they'd all be
pooping their pants up there

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.528
but they actually look cool as hell.

00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:28.170
They managed to transform this giant arena

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.556
used almost exclusively for
professional bull riding

00:12:30.556 --> 00:12:33.082
into a banging rock concert? Fuck!

00:12:33.082 --> 00:12:35.341
I'm not better than these guys.

00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:38.035
I'm just some creep who
paid a hundred dollars to

00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:40.175
bring his wife to a Kidz Bop concert.

00:12:40.175 --> 00:12:43.006
And I think I'm a fan
now? How did this happen?

00:12:43.006 --> 00:12:46.235
Why am I having so much
fun? This is fantastic.

00:12:46.235 --> 00:12:48.185
You know, I guess it
just goes to show you.

00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:50.779
Sometimes things may not
go according to plan.

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:53.044
Sometimes they're even better.

00:12:53.044 --> 00:12:54.922
This morning, I thought
I wanted to join Kidz Bop

00:12:54.922 --> 00:12:56.978
so I could destroy them, but now it's

00:12:56.978 --> 00:13:00.121
because I'm excited to be
taken under their wing.

00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:03.170
I have so much to learn
and I can't wait to start.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.293
Thanks Kidz Bop.

00:13:04.293 --> 00:13:07.381
This turned out to be
the best day of my life.

00:13:07.381 --> 00:13:11.881
(Kidz Bop All the Small Things cover)

00:13:13.574 --> 00:13:16.924
Man, fuck this I'm going to gator land.

00:13:16.924 --> 00:13:18.286
Thank you guys so much
for watching this video.

00:13:18.286 --> 00:13:19.119
I want to give a huge shout-out

00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:20.077
to today's sponsor, Squarespace.

00:13:20.077 --> 00:13:21.569
And this video is going to have

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:22.816
like 17 copyright claims on it.

00:13:22.816 --> 00:13:24.462
So the only money I'm getting is going

00:13:24.462 --> 00:13:25.406
to be from our sponsors.

00:13:25.406 --> 00:13:26.537
So please consider supporting them.

00:13:26.537 --> 00:13:28.169
Squarespace as a service
I've used several times

00:13:28.169 --> 00:13:29.812
in the past, and also right now.

00:13:29.812 --> 00:13:31.675
That's right, I just made this website

00:13:31.675 --> 00:13:33.229
and it took me like five minutes.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.197
It's realpictureofhotdog.com.

00:13:35.197 --> 00:13:37.137
You can go there and look at the hot dog,

00:13:37.137 --> 00:13:38.970
you can download the hot dog,

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.289
you can't taste the hot dog yet.

00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:43.455
We're still working on that function.

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:45.813
But hopefully by 2026,
that'll be up and running.

00:13:45.813 --> 00:13:46.709
I hope this is proof

00:13:46.709 --> 00:13:47.988
that you don't need any
coding experience to

00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:49.264
make a website on Squarespace.

00:13:49.264 --> 00:13:50.350
It's super easy to use,
they've got a bunch

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.359
of beautiful designer
templates to start with.

00:13:52.359 --> 00:13:54.010
And from there it's just drag and drop.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.502
Trust me if I can do it, so can you.

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:56.633
And if you guys want to get 10%
