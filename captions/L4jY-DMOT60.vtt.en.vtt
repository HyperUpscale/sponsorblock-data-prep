00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.640
- 'Sup, you beautiful bastards?

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.170
Hope you're having a fantastic Tuesday.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.080
Also, is that the most tone
deaf intro at this point?

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.110
I feel like I'm saying that

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.010
while the set behind me is on fire.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.500
Or may be it's more
hopeful or aspirational.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.870
Either way, welcome back to
the Philip DeFranco Show.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.550
Buckle up, hit that like button,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.890
and let's just jump into it.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.870
And the first thing we're going to talk

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.840
about today is non-coronavirus news.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.120
It turns out there is still some.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.320
So if you're unaware,
there's this new viral trend

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.330
that has resulted in a number
of big people under fire.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.350
You might have already seen
an example of this trend

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.500
on your timeline, over Twitter,
Facebook, TikTok, whatever,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.590
but mug shots right
now are rather popular.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.080
Right, there are numerous
examples of this.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.670
You've had users making
compilation videos of real mugshots

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.930
featuring people they find
interesting or attractive.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.763
That eventually morphed

00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:44.000
into people staging
their own mugshot photos.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.190
And a typical post here would be someone

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.060
with messy hair, smudged mascara,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.930
some costume makeup that
roughens up their look.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.130
Some holding up signs of fake

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.630
or phoney reasons for their arrest.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.160
Others have even pretended
to get into fights

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.620
or staged scenarios that
might lead to a fake arrest.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.530
Some have also taken it
further, adding fake bruises,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.170
black eyes, bloody noses.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.050
And while there are people that
had issues with this trend,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.610
especially the ones with
bruised or bloody faces,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.400
the people that ended up
getting hit the hardest

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.300
were three massive influencers.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.010
Be the likes of Youtuber James Charles,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.690
TikTok creator Avani Gregg,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.640
and a Vlog Squad member, Corinna Kopf.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.880
Now this could have also been impart

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.830
because these creators posted
on Instagram and Twitter,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.740
where some were unaware
of the TikTok trend,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.670
and so people were confused and surprised.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.970
James Charles, for
instance, posted his look

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.803
without a caption and he was flooded

00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:23.260
with comments accusing him

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.900
of triggering domestic violence survivors

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.990
and glamorizing abuse.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.730
And according to Insider
in a since deleted tweet,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.520
James said that he changed
his Instagram caption

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.850
to joke about getting punched,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.830
but he changed it back soon after

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.490
because making that joke wasn't funny.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.040
But still, his replies were full

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.530
of stories from domestic
violence survivors

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.760
who found the look offensive.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.610
And you know, in those comments

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.780
we saw him defending himself,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.780
trying to explain the trend,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.110
that it has nothing to
do with domestic abuse,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.160
writing, "What about action movies?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.410
Halloween? Special effects?

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.420
Simple bloody noses?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.280
This is nothing new."

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.280
Also in now deleted tweets,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.330
he also pointed to bloody looks

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.920
by The Weeknd and Billie Eilish,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.300
writing, "I haven't seen a single tweet

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.210
about him glorifying violence or abuse.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.820
Can someone please explain
how it's any different?

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.080
I'm really trying to understand."

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.850
But ultimately, he ended
up deleting that post

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.150
and wrote, "Despite the fact that hundreds

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.580
of other influencers and artists

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.660
have done something similar,
I deleted the mugshot trend

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.830
because it was never my
intention to trigger anyone,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.890
and it's a waste of time trying
to have an open discussion

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.410
with people who hate me regardless."

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.470
We also saw Avani Gregg respond

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.910
to the backlash, apologizing.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.210
Then going on to explain the storyline

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.540
for the character she took on
in a series of TikTok posts.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.270
Corinna also deleting her photos as well,

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.210
though I haven't seen her
release any sort of statement.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.540
Which honestly, makes sense.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.740
I mean, often times these days

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.820
the best response is no response.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.000
And often instead of
calming down a situation,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.660
it amplifies and it opens you
up for an even bigger hit.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.820
And I mean just look at this situation.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.940
The person who has become
the face of this controversy

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.050
and scandal around this
trend is James Charles.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.190
Like if you just look
at the coverage today,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.060
his face is plastered everywhere.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.610
And also understand, I'm not blaming him

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.970
for responding to what's happening,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.420
but I think it highlights why
others often do not speak.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.530
With this story, I did want to
pass the question off to you.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.539
What are your thoughts on this?

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.290
Do you think that this trend
is stupid, it's offensive.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.631
And if you do think that
it's offensive, right,

00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:51.190
is it more of the domestic violence angle?

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.810
Or, I've seen a lot of people arguing

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.770
that it's dismissive
of mass incarceration.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.840
Or you're on the other end of this.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.700
Do you think that this
is completely overblown?

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.070
You people seeing this out of context,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.280
not understanding the trend,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.420
they're just lashing out.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.790
Yeah, what are your thoughts
on this, let me know.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.370
But from that, I want to
share some stuff I love today.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.550
And today, an awesome,
brought to you by Keeps.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.383
And if you didn't know,

00:03:08.383 --> 00:03:10.000
two out of three guys
will experience some form

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.980
of male pattern baldness

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.100
by the time that they're 35.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.040
Right, and if you think
about it, you know,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.120
we all have that one brother,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.530
that uncle, that friend,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.270
and if you don't want that for yourself,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.780
you don't have to just sit idly by.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.950
And Keeps helps you stop hair
loss before it's too late

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.690
with their scientific
and affordable approach.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.080
Their treatments are up to 90% effective

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.650
at reducing and stopping
further hair loss,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.320
and they say prevention is key.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.420
You also don't have to go
broke to avoid going bald.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.690
Keeps offers generic versions

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.710
of the only two FDA
approved hair loss products

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.543
that are out there.

00:03:33.543 --> 00:03:34.760
So some of you may have
actually tried them before

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.310
but probably never for this price.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.100
And actually on that
note, for a limited time,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.110
you beautiful bastards can
get your order for 50% off.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.260
So, if you're ready to take
action and prevent hair loss,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.810
go to Keeps.com/DeFranco
or just click that link

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.680
in the description down below

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.510
to receive 50% off your first order.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.520
And the first bit of awesome today is

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.290
after today's show you
want to watch two clips

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.080
with myself and Shawn Evans, you can.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.910
In one we talk about the
use of certain substances,

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.450
and the other is talking about why we

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.110
as Americans need Joe
Biden and Donald Trump

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.730
on an episode of "Hot Ones".

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.900
Screw a town hall debate.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.260
This is how we get answers.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
We got the trailer for
"Extraction" with Chris Hemsworth

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.410
that drops on Netflix in
just under three weeks.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.730
And Adam Sandler and Jimmy Fallon

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.202
performing "Don't Touch Grandma".

00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:12.830
And Binging with Babish
is giving us brisket

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.220
from "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel".

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.380
A New Yorker gave us the streets

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.900
of New York City under quarantine.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.750
Vanity Fair gave us
"Looney Tunes" voice actor

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.590
improvises 12 new cartoon voices.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.060
And Comedy Central gave us Dan Levy

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.120
on how the Schitts Creek
characters would quarantine.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.220
And if you want to see the full versions

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.150
of everything I just shared,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.260
the secret link of the day,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.720
really anything at all,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.560
links, as always, are in
the description down below.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.520
And then let's talk about
our douche bag of the day.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.690
Lorraine Maradiaga.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.590
And Lorraine is a very
special 18 year old girl

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.490
in Texas who is now facing a charge

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.080
of making a terroristic threat.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.760
And the reason she's facing that charge is

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.250
that there are these Snapchat
videos of her going around

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.130
where it appears to show her going

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.780
to a drive through testing site,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.270
where a nurse is heard telling the person

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.010
behind the steering wheel
that they need to go home

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.090
while they wait for results.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.616
And then later in a
number of other videos,

00:04:54.616 --> 00:04:57.258
one, we see her in what
she claims to be a Walmart.

00:04:57.258 --> 00:04:59.711
- I'm here at Walmart
about to infest (censored)

00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:00.861
because if I'm going down,

00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:02.422
all y'all (censored) are going down.

00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:03.300
Look, my earring even going down.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.058
- We also see her in her
car coughing on camera.

00:05:06.058 --> 00:05:09.053
- If you want to get the coronavirus,

00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:14.327
and die, call me.

00:05:14.327 --> 00:05:15.590
And I will meet you up

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.893
and (coughs) all over you.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.249
And I will shorten your life.

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:25.410
- There's also another
clip that I can't play

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.720
'cause there's copyrighted music in it.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.060
But it appears to show her acknowledging

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.470
that people have been screen recording

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.570
those previous videos.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.670
She says, "I don't care.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.503
Make me famous."

00:05:32.503 --> 00:05:34.170
And so I guess to Lorrainne, I wanna say

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.240
I and the Carrollton Texas
Police are happy to do our part.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.440
And to anyone out there that
happens across this video

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.720
and has information,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.450
The Carrollton Texas Police would love

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.760
for you to call this number

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.820
or email this email because
she's still out there.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.290
She's said to be charged with the crime.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.610
The police are looking for her.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.760
Her family is reportedly
working with the authorities.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.947
And to Lorrainne, I think you're about

00:05:53.947 --> 00:05:55.550
to get a lesson in the difference

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.730
between famous and infamous.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.090
You are not only our
douche bag of the day,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.937
but another prime example
that allows me to say

00:06:02.937 --> 00:06:05.480
don't be stupid, stupid.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.550
And then of course let's talk

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.140
about our daily coronavirus numbers.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.740
As of 4 p.m. Eastern Time,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.910
worldwide, there are now
1.4 million confirmed cases

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.130
81,103 total deaths.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.047
Total recoveries at 297,934.

00:06:18.047 --> 00:06:19.340
And in the United States,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.150
there are 386,800 confirmed cases,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.020
12,285 deaths,

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.790
20,191 confirmed recoveries.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.210
Now regarding coronavirus numbers,

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.180
something interesting
in the United States is

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.013
that it appears to be

00:06:31.013 --> 00:06:33.440
disproportionally impacting
African American communities.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.620
And the percentages here
are rather staggering,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.990
right, taking a look at Louisiana.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.990
The state has a little under 15,000 cases,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.947
over 500 deaths,

00:06:39.947 --> 00:06:42.890
and of those who died 70% were black

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.360
and that was a standout percentage

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.980
because black people makeup
roughly 1/3 of the population.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.440
With the states governor,
John Bel Edwards,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.810
calling this figure disturbing

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.550
and adding, "That deserves more attention

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.810
and we're going to have to dig into that

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.650
and see what we can do
to slow that trend down."

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.940
But, Louisiana is far from alone.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.151
Take Chicago, for example.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.470
Their 1/3 of the population

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.060
is comprised of African Americans,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.763
they've lost 118 people to this virus.

00:07:02.763 --> 00:07:06.140
And of the 118 people Chicago
has lost to this virus,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.700
81 of those are black residents,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.730
making them 70% of the total deaths there.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.130
In Milwaukee where African Americans

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.140
make up 27% of the population,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.460
they make up 35 of the 49 deaths thus far.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.360
And looking at all of this,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.330
according to the New York Times,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.180
there are multiple factors
that lead to these numbers.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.700
African Americans are generally considered

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.210
a higher risk in any outbreak.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.043
This is because it's said

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:25.300
that they're less likely to be insured,

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.070
more likely to have
pre-existing conditions,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.750
and because of implicit racial bias,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.750
they're being denied testing
and treatment at a higher rate.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.710
So you pair that with the fact

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.280
that they're also less likely to have jobs

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.460
that allow them to work from home.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.520
And in fact, according to
the Economic Policy Institute

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.080
while 30% of white Americans

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.620
and 37% of Asian Americans
can work from home,

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.450
only 20% of African Americans can

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.700
with that number being smaller

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.200
for Hispanic and Latina workers.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.930
And so all of that
combined with lower access

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.050
to adequate healthcare puts them

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.550
in an incredibly vulnerable spot.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.130
And understand, it's not just these places

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.523
that I'm mentioning right
now experiencing this.

00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:53.815
Numbers of cities and states are seeing

00:07:53.815 --> 00:07:55.330
this pattern as well,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.300
but also there's a lack of information

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.220
from a number of places.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.540
Right, according to NBC News,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.960
as of right now only eight
states and DC have reported

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.510
how the coronavirus has
impacted various demographics

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.790
like racial population.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.040
Now this lack of reporting could stem

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.980
from a number of reasons.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.920
Firstly, states are not required to do so

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.530
but also secondly,
collecting all this data

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.630
could be difficult and even
if the data is collected,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.450
some might fear the
information's unreliable.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.870
But also there are big efforts
right now urging states

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.630
and federal governments
to share this information

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.650
so that this huge
imbalance can be addressed.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.677
What some politicians arguing,

00:08:22.677 --> 00:08:24.450
"This lack of information will exacerbate

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.120
existing health disparities and result

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.120
in the loss of lives in
vulnerable communities.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.310
It will also hamper the efforts
of public health officials

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.040
to track and contain the novel coronavirus

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.530
in the areas that are at the highest risk

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.380
of continued spread."

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.770
But ultimately for now
we have to wait to see

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.540
what happens there and also
if this trend continues.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.960
And then lets talk about elections.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.810
Because, yes, the election later this year

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.150
it is a big deal,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.110
but in fact the Wisconsin
primary election is

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.970
happening right now.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.180
This is a huge deal because
Wisconsin is the first state

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.680
to hold a major in person election

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.920
since the majority of states issued

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.540
shelter-in-place orders,
including, the state of Wisconsin.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.650
It also makes the state the only one

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.220
to hold in-person elections this month

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.080
after more than a dozen
other states pushed theirs.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.490
With this election
today there's been a lot

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.610
of confusion back and forth

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.150
over whether or not it
was actually happening.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.500
So let's break down what happened, right,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.700
so yesterday Democratic
governor Tony Evers

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.130
issued an executive order delaying

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.510
the election until June 9th.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.343
And according to reports,

00:09:09.343 --> 00:09:10.590
Evers held off on this move until

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.920
the last minute for a few reasons.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.250
First, it's not just the primary,

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.990
in fact a lot of local
offices on the ballot

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.440
there start their terms in April.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440
And secondly, it's said that this is

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.690
because state law says that only

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.096
the state legislature can
change the date of the election.

00:09:21.096 --> 00:09:23.700
Now the GOP live legislature
refused to change the date

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.960
or allow the election to go forward

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.180
with all mail-in ballots.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.980
So, when Evers went ahead
with the executive order,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.250
the state legislature filed
a legal challenge saying

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.190
that the governor was exceeding

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.450
his constitutional authority.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.200
And shortly after that
the states Supreme Court,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.820
which has a conservative
majority right now,

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.760
shot down the order

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.650
and said that the election
had to happen today.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.240
And in fact, in another kick to Evers,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.370
the U.S. Supreme Court
blocked a federal court ruling

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.900
that would've extended absentee
voting until April 13th.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.650
And in a five to four vote,
the Supreme Court ruled

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.727
that extending the deadline
for absentee voting quote,

00:09:48.727 --> 00:09:50.687
"Fundamentally alters the
nature of the election".

00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:52.790
Now all four of the
liberal justices dissented

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.097
with Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing,

00:09:54.097 --> 00:09:56.040
"The question here is
whether tens of thousands

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.780
of Wisconsin citizens can vote safely

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.990
in the midst of a pandemic.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.350
With the majority's stay in place,

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.500
that will not be possible.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.160
Either they will have to brave the polls,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.010
endangering their own and others' safety,

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.440
or they will lose their right to vote

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.760
through no fault of their own."

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.920
And so it seems that, in fact,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.798
that's the decision that
voters had to make today.

00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:12.450
And but it's also not just the voters

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.710
you're talking about poll
workers, election officials.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.220
While officials have said
they're taking precautions

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.730
to protect their health
at voting precincts,

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.240
they've also said that all this legal back

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.490
and forth has created confusion
and logistical problems.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.770
This is also made worst by the fact that

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.670
thousands of poll workers
have refused to work

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.640
with some reportedly saying

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.280
that they were being asked
to risk their health.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.800
And that's why we were
seeing, according to reports,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.290
roughly 2,400 National
Guardsmen were being trained

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.800
as poll workers as late as Monday.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.550
Though reportedly it
still will not come close

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.387
to the more than 7,000

00:10:35.387 --> 00:10:37.150
who have already said
that they cannot work.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.630
And because of the lack of poll workers,

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.070
officials have shut down
tons of polling stations.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.560
With one of the most dramatic
examples being in Milwaukee

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.720
where the number of polling locations

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.100
was cut from 180 to five.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.890
This, despite the fact that
election workers expect

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.030
more than 50,000 voters to turn out today.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.110
Which also means that
those who do decide to vote

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.520
and wait in the super long line,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.610
also risk exposing themselves
to even more people

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.840
at each individual location.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.673
Right, in regarding that note,

00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:00.550
we saw a lot of people
sharing videos on Twitter

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.370
of lines wrapping around buildings,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.520
spanning whole blocks.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.880
And while a lot of people did
seem to be social distancing,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.550
we also saw a lot of
people taking to Twitter

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.620
to criticize this move

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.310
with Wisconsin trending on Twitter.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.650
And there we saw a lot of users saying

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.930
that the move was un-democratic

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.150
or was voter suppression.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.760
Some directly accusing
the states republicans

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.100
of endangering their people,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.980
others condemning the SCOTUS decision.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.110
A lot of those points were
echoed by Bernie Sanders

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.900
who tweeted, "It's outrageous
that the Republican

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.980
legislative leaders and
the conservative majority

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.900
on the Supreme Court in
Wisconsin are willing

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.360
to risk the health and
safety of many thousands

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.930
of Wisconsin voters tomorrow
for their own political gain.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.880
Holding this election amid
the coronavirus outbreak

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.840
is dangerous, disregards the guidance

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.610
of public health experts, and
may very well prove deadly.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.620
For that reason, our
campaign will not be engaged

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.550
in any traditional Get
Out The Vote efforts."

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.330
Now, Joe Biden for his
part has not said much

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.270
since the decision,

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.717
but on Thursday he took a
different stand telling reporters,

00:11:47.717 --> 00:11:49.530
"There's a lot of things that can be done,

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.640
that's for the Wisconsin
courts and folks to decide."

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.810
With Biden reportedly going on
to insist that the in-person

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.980
and mail-in voting could
both be done safely.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.140
Now that said it should be noted

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.100
that in the other side of this

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.860
you also have people
applauding the decision,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.010
saying that it was a good move.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.500
Others seemingly downplaying the move

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.570
like one Republican county
chair named Jim Miller,

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.390
who said, "If you can go
out and get fast food,

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.660
you can go vote curbside.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.750
It's the same procedure."

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.060
We also had Trump chiming in this morning,

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.910
telling people to go out

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.930
to vote for conservative
supreme court justice.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.530
And ultimately that is
where we are right now.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.890
Right, we have to wait and
see how this impacts turn out

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.500
and unfortunately if this impacts

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.690
the spread of the coronavirus.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.470
And as far as the official
results from this election,

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.303
it doesn't seem that we're going

00:12:22.303 --> 00:12:23.610
to be getting those later today.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.580
And that's because the federal judge

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.020
that initially allowed absentee ballots

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.060
to be sent until April 13th also ruled

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.580
that election officials
had to hold results

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.560
until that same day.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.393
And according to reports,

00:12:31.393 --> 00:12:33.380
the SCOTUS decision that
overruled the federal court

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.690
doesn't seem to have changed that part.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.940
Right so, we have to wait
until Monday to see anything,

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.450
but when we do see the
results it will be meaningful.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.350
Because, yes, while you have
FiveThirtyEight predicting

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.700
that Biden has a 90% chance
of winning the most votes,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.530
for me the most interesting
thing to watch is

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.210
what is the turn out of
republicans versus democrats.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.440
Wisconsin is a key battle ground state.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.880
Trump won it in 2016.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.400
He turned the state red for
the first time in 30 years.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.080
Right, so it was already
an important state

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.770
but then you throw in a just huge variable

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.510
and the coronavirus pandemic.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.950
And when you look at
other polls in general,

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.130
republicans are less worried

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.080
about the coronavirus
compared to democrats.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.350
Right, so not only how much
has that changed voter turn out

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.700
but how much does it change
voter turn out by party?

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.060
And so Wisconsin essentially
becomes the first test case for

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.630
what kind of turn out we might see

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.540
if this situation rolls into November.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.020
But for now we have to
wait for those results

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.870
and with this also I want to
pass the question off to you.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.750
What are your personal thoughts

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.590
about elections still being
held in Wisconsin today?

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.630
And that is where I'm
going to end today's show.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.190
