on<00:07:13.919><c> the</c><00:07:14.160><c> plane</c><00:07:14.639><c> it's</c><00:07:14.800><c> cool</c><00:07:15.120><c> but</c><00:07:15.440><c> i'd</c><00:07:15.599><c> rather</c>

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
on the plane it's cool but i'd rather
 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.309 align:start position:0%
on the plane it's cool but i'd rather
see<00:07:16.000><c> a</c><00:07:16.080><c> crumple</c><00:07:16.479><c> and</c><00:07:16.720><c> tear</c><00:07:17.199><c> apart</c><00:07:17.759><c> right</c><00:07:17.919><c> there</c>

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
see a crumple and tear apart right there
 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.589 align:start position:0%
see a crumple and tear apart right there
it's<00:07:18.479><c> very</c><00:07:18.639><c> much</c><00:07:18.800><c> like</c><00:07:18.960><c> it</c><00:07:19.039><c> kind</c><00:07:19.199><c> of</c><00:07:19.360><c> breaks</c>

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's very much like it kind of breaks
 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.670 align:start position:0%
it's very much like it kind of breaks
into<00:07:19.840><c> the</c><00:07:20.000><c> cabins</c><00:07:20.479><c> it</c><00:07:20.560><c> seems</c><00:07:21.120><c> very</c><00:07:21.280><c> much</c><00:07:21.520><c> so</c>

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
into the cabins it seems very much so
 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.189 align:start position:0%
into the cabins it seems very much so
intentional<00:07:22.160><c> so</c><00:07:22.240><c> you</c><00:07:22.400><c> can</c><00:07:22.479><c> see</c><00:07:22.639><c> the</c><00:07:22.720><c> entirety</c>

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
intentional so you can see the entirety
 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.350 align:start position:0%
intentional so you can see the entirety
of<00:07:23.280><c> the</c><00:07:23.440><c> plane</c><00:07:24.000><c> i</c><00:07:24.080><c> don't</c><00:07:24.400><c> think</c><00:07:24.720><c> a</c><00:07:24.880><c> wing</c><00:07:25.120><c> would</c>

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
of the plane i don't think a wing would
 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.790 align:start position:0%
of the plane i don't think a wing would
actually<00:07:25.759><c> break</c><00:07:26.080><c> like</c><00:07:26.240><c> that</c><00:07:26.479><c> it</c><00:07:26.560><c> would</c>

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
actually break like that it would
 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.550 align:start position:0%
actually break like that it would
probably<00:07:27.120><c> snap</c><00:07:27.520><c> off</c><00:07:27.759><c> before</c><00:07:28.080><c> it</c><00:07:28.160><c> would</c><00:07:28.319><c> just</c>

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
probably snap off before it would just
 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.270 align:start position:0%
probably snap off before it would just
like

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.070 align:start position:0%
like

that<00:07:32.240><c> was</c><00:07:32.479><c> actually</c><00:07:32.720><c> pretty</c><00:07:32.960><c> sweet</c><00:07:33.280><c> looking</c>

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
that was actually pretty sweet looking
 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.510 align:start position:0%
that was actually pretty sweet looking
but<00:07:34.160><c> the</c><00:07:34.400><c> actual</c><00:07:34.800><c> like</c>

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
but the actual like
 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
but the actual like
nuclear<00:07:36.160><c> bomb</c><00:07:36.639><c> thing</c><00:07:36.960><c> kind</c><00:07:37.120><c> of</c><00:07:37.199><c> looked</c><00:07:37.520><c> uh</c>

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
nuclear bomb thing kind of looked uh
 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.909 align:start position:0%
nuclear bomb thing kind of looked uh
the<00:07:38.560><c> mushroom</c><00:07:38.960><c> stick</c><00:07:39.360><c> it's</c><00:07:39.520><c> pretty</c><00:07:39.680><c> much</c>

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
the mushroom stick it's pretty much
 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.189 align:start position:0%
the mushroom stick it's pretty much
because<00:07:40.400><c> they're</c><00:07:40.560><c> hitting</c><00:07:40.800><c> a</c><00:07:40.880><c> button</c><00:07:41.120><c> you've</c>

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
because they're hitting a button you've
 

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
because they're hitting a button you've
got<00:07:41.360><c> gas</c><00:07:41.680><c> come</c><00:07:41.919><c> out</c><00:07:42.160><c> and</c><00:07:42.240><c> then</c><00:07:42.800><c> the</c><00:07:42.960><c> gas</c>

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
got gas come out and then the gas
 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.629 align:start position:0%
got gas come out and then the gas
converts<00:07:43.840><c> in</c><00:07:43.919><c> the</c><00:07:44.000><c> fire</c><00:07:44.319><c> base</c><00:07:44.479><c> in</c><00:07:44.560><c> the</c>

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
converts in the fire base in the
 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.909 align:start position:0%
converts in the fire base in the
temperature<00:07:45.039><c> and</c><00:07:45.199><c> it</c><00:07:45.280><c> just</c><00:07:45.520><c> creates</c><00:07:45.759><c> this</c>

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
temperature and it just creates this
 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:47.670 align:start position:0%
temperature and it just creates this

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
curl and because that's just the kind of
 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.270 align:start position:0%
curl and because that's just the kind of
perfect<00:07:48.080><c> mushroom</c><00:07:48.560><c> and</c><00:07:48.720><c> there's</c><00:07:48.879><c> not</c><00:07:49.039><c> much</c>

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
do is break it up and add a lot more
 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.230 align:start position:0%

right<00:08:27.360><c> everything's</c><00:08:27.759><c> wet</c><00:08:28.000><c> so</c><00:08:28.160><c> it</c><00:08:28.160><c> should</c><00:08:28.319><c> be</c>

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
right everything's wet so it should be
 

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:29.909 align:start position:0%
right everything's wet so it should be

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
the plane would actually be a much

the plane would actually be a much

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then they just camped out the led
 

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.750 align:start position:0%
and then they just camped out the led
lights<00:08:48.160><c> and</c><00:08:48.240><c> put</c><00:08:48.480><c> fire</c><00:08:48.800><c> in</c><00:08:48.959><c> but</c><00:08:49.200><c> you</c><00:08:49.279><c> get</c><00:08:49.519><c> that</c>

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
lights and put fire in but you get that
 

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.509 align:start position:0%
lights and put fire in but you get that
illumination<00:08:50.399><c> effect</c><00:08:50.959><c> so</c><00:08:51.120><c> it's</c><00:08:51.200><c> like</c><00:08:51.360><c> you</c>

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
illumination effect so it's like you
 

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:53.350 align:start position:0%
illumination effect so it's like you
have<00:08:51.680><c> all</c><00:08:51.839><c> of</c><00:08:52.000><c> this</c><00:08:52.240><c> lighting</c><00:08:52.640><c> and</c><00:08:52.720><c> that's</c>

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
have all of this lighting and that's
 

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.750 align:start position:0%
have all of this lighting and that's
actual<00:08:53.760><c> real</c><00:08:54.000><c> lighting</c><00:08:54.399><c> filmed</c><00:08:54.720><c> on</c><00:08:55.040><c> set</c><00:08:55.600><c> and</c>

actual real lighting filmed on set and
 

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.509 align:start position:0%

00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
so you're getting all that illumination
 

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:59.670 align:start position:0%
so you're getting all that illumination

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
the fire is just phasing through the

so<00:09:58.240><c> one</c><00:09:58.399><c> thing</c><00:09:58.560><c> you'll</c><00:09:58.720><c> notice</c><00:09:58.959><c> about</c><00:09:59.120><c> this</c><00:09:59.360><c> is</c>

00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
so one thing you'll notice about this is
 

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.790 align:start position:0%
so one thing you'll notice about this is
that<00:09:59.839><c> none</c><00:10:00.080><c> of</c><00:10:00.160><c> the</c><00:10:00.240><c> buildings</c><00:10:00.560><c> actually</c>

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
