- This episode of LegalEagle

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.600
was made possible by Skillshare.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.850
Learn to think like a lawyer
for free for two months

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.930
by clicking the link in the description.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.960
Some of the facts are
contested and some are not.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.900
Ahmaud Arbery, a 25 year
old man was shot to death

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.080
on February 23rd in Brunswick, Georgia.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.730
Arbery was being followed
by Gregory McMichael

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.840
and Travis McMichael,
his son, in their truck.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.070
Arbery's family says
that he was out jogging

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.070
while the McMichaels say that
they thought he was a burglar.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.810
Two things that are not
necessarily mutually exclusive.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.580
Three prosecutors recused themselves

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.000
from handling the case due
to conflicts of interest.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.820
Initially, the McMichaels
were not arrested

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.460
or charged with Arbery's death.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.430
Then a disturbing video of the killing

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.970
was released to the public.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.750
The video provoked outrage
and spurred state authorities

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.930
to actually act.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.960
And the two McMichaels were arrested

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.120
for felony murder 74
days after the killing.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.280
Now the case is a flashpoint
for arguments about racism

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.530
and conflicts of interest,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.320
stand your ground laws
and citizen's arrests.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.340
Politicians like Joe
Biden and President Trump

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.600
have both weighed in and understandably,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.160
everyone has lots of
questions about this case,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.590
some things we can probably
be fairly certain about.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.690
And some things we may never know.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.953
But either way, let's think like a lawyer.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.750
Now, before we get into
too much of the analysis

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.120
in this particular case,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.840
I think a couple of
disclaimers are in order.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.490
Number one, everyone is
entitled to the presumption

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370
of innocence in the
criminal justice system.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.120
When you are accused of a crime,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.760
it is the prosecutor's duty to prove

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.550
that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.430
It doesn't necessarily
mean that you're innocent

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.070
if the prosecution
doesn't meet that burden.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.860
But it does mean that you are
entitled to that presumption.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.150
Now when we're talking about
things in popular culture,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.240
we don't necessarily use

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.290
the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.730
But in a case like this,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.030
some of the evidence is known,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.510
some of it's public, some of its not,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.890
and some of the information
may never be known.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.910
So we'll never know the objective truth

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.170
with respect to the situation,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.110
and multiple things can
be true at the same time.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.760
So more information is going to come out

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.620
and we're going to be
analyzing things based

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.020
on what we know today, that may change.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.740
Evidence may come out
that supports prosecution

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.110
or supports the defense.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.180
We don't know what is out there

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.120
and what isn't out there,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.010
and what may or may not come to light.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.500
Oh, and finally,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.333
we're going to be looking

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:17.240
at some fairly disturbing
cellphone and security footage.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.003
So if you are bothered
by that sort of thing,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.833
just be aware.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:22.920
With that being said,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.700
let's dig into the facts
as we currently know them.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.220
According to the police report,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.660
sometime around 1:00
p.m. Gregory McMichael

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.260
was in his son's front yard

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.140
when he saw Ahmaud Arbery
running down the street.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.127
He ran inside and called out to his son,

00:02:36.127 --> 00:02:39.020
"Travis, the guy is running
down the street, let's go."

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.280
Gregory grabbed his 357 Magnum

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.280
while Travis picked up his shotgun.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.620
They ran outside and got in their truck.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.820
Now according to the police report,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.980
a third man later identified
as neighbor William Bryan,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.930
followed in a separate vehicle.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.950
Brian filmed the chase itself.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.630
The McMichaels say that Bryan also trying

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.470
to block Arbery during the pursuit,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.300
but Bryan disputes this claim.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.500
Now because I think It's
important to the analysis

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.333
that goes on here,

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:05.300
here is the video footage
taken from the cell phone

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.997
of Bryan as he was in
pursuit of Ahmaud Arbery.

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:32.669
(gunshot explodes)

00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:36.832
(gunshot explodes)

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.977
(gunshot explodes)

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.270
So allegedly Travis
McMichael drove down the road

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.620
until he spotted Arbery
running toward an intersection.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.150
Travis trying to cut him off.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.797
This led Arbery to start

00:03:53.797 --> 00:03:56.260
"running back in the
direction from which he came,"

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.400
according to the police report.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.930
Travis trying to cut him off
with the truck a second time,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.970
then Gregory jumped into the truck bed

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.030
and then continued to chase Arbery down.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.060
Gregory and Travis told police

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.893
that they started yelling,

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:09.910
"Stop, stop, we want to talk to you."

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.210
Arbery didn't stop.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.990
Next, Travis pulled up next to Aubrey

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.100
and said he wanted to talk.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.720
He then left the truck
with a shotgun in hand.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.040
Gregory then told police
that Arbery started

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.950
to violently attack Travis,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.260
and the two men then started
fighting over the shotgun,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.500
at which point Travis fired a
shot and then a second later,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.120
there was a second shot.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.417
Gregory then told police
that Arbery started to

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:32.667
"violently attack Travis

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:35.227
"and the two men then started
fighting over the shotgun,

00:04:35.227 --> 00:04:37.287
"at which point Travis
fired a second shot.

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:38.467
"And then a second later,

00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:39.997
"there was a second shot.

00:04:39.997 --> 00:04:42.697
"McMichael stated that
the male fell face down

00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:45.247
"on the pavement with
his hand under his body."

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.570
Now according to the autopsy,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.340
Arbery was shot a total of three times,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.480
once in the hand and twice in the chest.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.400
Travis then searched Arbery for a gun,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.950
which there wasn't one and
Arbery bled out on the spot

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.400
dying in a matter of minutes.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.790
Gregory McDaniel told police

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.390
that he thought Arbery was a burglar

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.450
who had recently been
targeting the neighborhood.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.940
The McMichaels told police

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.230
that when they caught up with Arbery,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.870
he attacks Travis who fired
his weapon in self defense.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.480
Gregory and his son told police

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.070
that they saw Arbery "the other night,"

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.360
and that he reached in his pants
as if trying to draw a gun.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.260
They claimed that the
people in the neighborhood

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.210
were "fed up"

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.740
with the many burglaries in the area.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.573
Now, in this case,

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.430
I'm trying to provide a
robust version of events.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.190
Obviously, given the
nature of this dispute,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.430
only one side is going to
be able to tell their side

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.263
of the story,

00:05:32.263 --> 00:05:35.000
but I think it's important to
allow that side to be heard.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.100
Now, full disclosure,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.970
I think some of this is legally relevant,

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.210
and some of it is not actually
legally relevant based

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.800
on the charges and the potential defenses.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.440
But we'll get to that in a moment.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.280
But the important thing to
note is that some of the story

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.860
is told from one perspective,

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.390
some of these facts may be true,

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.860
some facts may not be true,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.850
but I think it's important
to at least allow that side

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.130
to be heard regardless

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.600
of what ultimately the
legal conclusion is.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.810
But let's talk about the evidence

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.720
from other sources as well.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.110
Gregory and Travis told
their story to police.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.140
Now Arbery is dead,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.650
obviously he can't tell
his side of the story.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.260
But there are additional sources
of evidence to this killing

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.400
and I'm trying to use
the term killing here

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.180
instead of murder because
that is a legally loaded term.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.080
But there is another known witness

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.280
and that is William
Bryan, who made the video.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.480
If there wasn't a tape,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.353
then we wouldn't know what happened.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.620
Or y'all wouldn't, I would.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.910
Bryan's attorney disputes
the McMichaels claim

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.880
that he was helping them chase Arbery

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.570
and also said that he had no
relationship with the family.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.480
Bryan describes himself as
a witness and nothing more.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.320
The Brunswick News obtained police records

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.690
about burglaries in the area.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.300
The records show that there had been

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.070
just one reported burglary
in the neighborhood

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.740
between January 1st and February 23rd.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.550
In particular, a handgun was stolen

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.250
from an unlocked truck parked

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.230
outside of Travis McMichael's
house on January 1st, 2020.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.750
And then on February 11th,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.740
Travis called police
to report a man walking

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.960
through a construction site near his home.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.190
Now according to the property owner,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.510
nothing was stolen.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.940
We don't know whether
Arbery was the person

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.930
in the construction site on February 11th.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.000
New videos are surfacing that
shows that there were in fact,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.150
other individuals besides Ahmaud Arbery,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.940
who had been looking at
the construction site.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.720
And obviously a lot of people have opined

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.570
that looking at houses
that are under construction

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.110
is something that
looky-loos do on occasion.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.780
And on the date in question,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.550
there were also two 911 calls

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.180
from shortly before the killing.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.180
On the first call at 1:08 p.m.,

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.387
an identified caller says,

00:07:29.387 --> 00:07:32.417
"There's a guy in a house right now,

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:34.530
"a house under construction."

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.740
The dispatcher asks if the man
is breaking into the property

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.647
to which the caller responds,

00:07:38.647 --> 00:07:40.017
"No, it's all open.

00:07:40.017 --> 00:07:41.440
"It's under construction."

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.480
The caller then says
he's running right now.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.240
And there he goes right now.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.397
The dispatcher asks,

00:07:46.397 --> 00:07:47.930
"Okay, what is he doing?"

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.240
The caller replies, "He's
running down the street.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.300
The dispatcher says,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.230
I just need to know
what he was doing wrong.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.800
Was he just on the premises
and not supposed to be.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.030
The caller's response is garbled
and after the noise fades,

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.500
the caller still provides no answer,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.680
but the dispatch says she
will send someone out.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.570
At 1:14pm, there's a second call,

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.140
a different unidentified person,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.750
potentially one of the McMichael says

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.120
that there's a black male
running down the street.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.050
This time the caller
again does not respond

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.280
to the dispatcher's request
for more information.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.217
The caller starts yelling,

00:08:15.217 --> 00:08:17.810
"Stop, stop that, dammit, stop!"

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.880
And a few seconds later,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.410
the caller yells Travis.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.810
The McMichaels have not said

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.990
whether they made the 911 calls.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.240
As the first call alludes to,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.960
there's also a surveillance video

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.340
from a construction
site near Travis's home.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.750
The video shows a man stopping
briefly to look around,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.020
the man who may be Arbery,
then continues to run.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.820
Arbery lived about two
miles from the subdivision.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.470
Now people have questioned whether Arbery

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.080
was just a man out for a jog.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.750
But there's no dispute whether
Arbery was really a runner.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.200
Neighbors verify that Arbery
had gone on daily runs

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.800
throughout the neighborhood for years.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.160
But this highlights some of the issues

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.410
that often come up with
eyewitness testimony.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.900
The objective facts may not line up

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.360
with witnesses subjective beliefs.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.170
It may be the case that Ahmaud Arbery

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.370
was in fact jogging that day.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.320
And it may also be the
case at the same time

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.180
that the McMichaels
thought he was a robber.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.010
And it may also be the case that

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.090
that subjective belief has
no bearing on their actions

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.130
or potential defenses to the fact

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.210
that they killed Ahmaud Arbery.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.440
We'll get to that in a moment.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.810
But I think it's important to note

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.680
that two things can be
true at the same time

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.760
in terms of what actually happened,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.990
and people's perception,

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.380
and their mental state at that time.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.860
Based on the available evidence,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.870
I think we can conclude a couple of things

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.810
to a strong likelihood.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.790
Again, that may change
based on different evidence,

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.020
but based on what we know now,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.710
I think we can assume a couple of things.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.630
Number one, Ahmaud Arbery
was running down the street.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.600
Number two, he was unarmed.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.580
Number three, the
McMichaels were in a truck

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.360
and had driven past Ahmaud Arbery

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.730
to get out in front of him.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.450
And the McMichaels were in fact armed

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:59.450
and got out of their truck
to confront Ahmaud Arbery.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.700
Now, based on those facts alone,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.680
I think we'll probably
have a good head start

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.730
in being able to examine
some of the defenses

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.700
and charges that were levied
against the McMichaels.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.600
But before we get there,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.160
we have to talk about the actions

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.660
of the local district attorney's,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.890
because based on the available evidence,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.810
it seems that things were potentially

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.460
not handled in a correct way.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.040
Now it took two months for the police

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.990
to actually arrest the McMichaels.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.823
During that time,

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:24.500
three prosecutors recused themselves

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.810
from handling the investigation
into Arbery's death.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.400
On February 27th, the
Brunswick District Attorney

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.350
recused herself from
the case because Gregory

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.880
had been an investigator in
the DA's office for 30 years.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.850
Gregory had also served as a
police officer for seven years.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.430
Then Prosecutor George Barnhill

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.400
was appointed to review the case.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.960
In late April, Barnhill
released a letter concluding

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.070
that McMichael had "solid
firsthand probable cause"

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.720
to pursue Arbery, a burglary suspect.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.330
He said Travis acted in self defense.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.690
He then recused himself from the case.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.120
Now recusal is the act
of a judge or prosecutor

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.300
being removed or excusing
themselves from legal case

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.740
due to a conflict of interest.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.460
Recusal happens when a prosecutor

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.430
cannot handle the case objectively.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.690
And here Barnhill admitted

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.000
he had personal connections to Arbery.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.900
Barnhill's son who is also
a Glynn county prosecutor

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.830
was involved in earlier
prosecution of Arbery.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.410
Arbery was given five years
probation as a first offender

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.500
on charges of carrying a weapon on-campus

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.260
and several counts of obstructing
a law enforcement officer.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.990
He was convicted of a
probation violation in 2018

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.720
after he was charged with shoplifting.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.980
Both Barnhill's son and Gregory McMichael

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.190
were involved in that investigation.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.490
And Barnhill advised Glynn County Police

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.050
not to charge the man even
before he was appointed

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.670
to prosecute the case.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.160
Barnhill admitted that he knew

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.127
about the conflicts of interest for

00:11:41.127 --> 00:11:42.640
"three or four weeks"

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.170
before recusing himself.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.670
For reasons that should be obvious,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.960
the victim's past criminal history

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.900
is almost always irrelevant
and unfairly prejudicial

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.670
to the prosecution of the
person that killed that person.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.760
Are there exceptions to that,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.530
but in this particular case,

00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.480
I don't think there's any way

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.060
that it would come in front of a jury,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.830
at least with respect to the McMichaels.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.590
But the way that Barnhill
handled his appointment

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.990
and recusal is almost
universally seen as problematic.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.230
If you're too conflicted
to handle the case,

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.750
you should not be giving your opinion

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.360
about whether crimes were committed.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.660
That's the entire purpose of recusal.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.250
But there's more evidence
that Barnhill was biased.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.727
He commented that Arbery's

00:12:21.727 --> 00:12:23.547
"mental health records
and prior convictions

00:12:23.547 --> 00:12:25.710
"demonstrated his aggressive nature."

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.930
He also disparaged Arbery's
family saying the family

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.080
are not strangers to the
local criminal justice system.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.430
From best we can tell,
Ahmaud's older brother

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.840
has gone to prison in the past

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.220
and is currently in the Glynn jail,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.530
without bond awaiting
new felony prosecution.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.410
It also appears a cousin
has been prosecuted

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.080
by DA Johnson's office.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.810
Now, none of that is
relevant to the prosecution

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.320
of someone who killed a victim here.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.170
It wouldn't have been relevant
if these things had happened

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.060
in the McMichaels's family,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.780
but it's doubly so when you're talking

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.800
about the potential victim
in a criminal case as well.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.200
So that information
was completely improper

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.410
to potentially taint potential jury pool.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.330
And remember, when we're evaluating

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.710
whether a person has a
conflict of interest,

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.030
we're concerned about
that person being biased.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.170
Barnhill's statements about
the Arbery family create,

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.380
at a minimum, the appearance of bias.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.710
And again, the family
status and even Arbery's

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.140
own criminal history aren't relevant.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.160
Now, the National District
Attorneys Association,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.220
which has 5000 members
and represents two thirds

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.810
of Georgia's prosecutors
condemned Barnhill

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.577
for making these statements, stating,

00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:30.587
"We must strongly disagree

00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:32.447
"with District Attorney
George Barnhill's decision

00:13:32.447 --> 00:13:35.297
"to share his opinion on whether
Greg and Travis McMichael

00:13:35.297 --> 00:13:38.527
"should be arrested after
he decided to recuse himself

00:13:38.527 --> 00:13:39.610
"from the case."

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.690
Georgia Attorney General Chris
Carr ordered an investigation

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.410
into the acts of both Glynn
County district attorneys

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.500
for failing to disclose
information indicating

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.430
that they had conflicts of interest.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.720
So in the wake of this
generally terrible situation

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.480
all around, at the request
of Governor Brian Kemp,

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.470
the Georgia Bureau of Investigation
opened an investigation

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.100
on May 5th, 2020.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.280
GBI reviewed the evidence and
canvassed the neighborhood.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.290
The GBI quickly arrested the McMichaels

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.070
on felony murder charges.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.430
And breaking as of today,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.620
Bryan was arrested on
charges of felony murder

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.320
for his participation in the affair.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.940
And remember that when you're
talking about a conspiracy

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.690
to commit a dangerous felony,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.970
even those individuals
that don't do the shooting

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.200
can be guilty of the murders
that result from the scheme.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.100
And I'm sure more will come
out about Bryan's participation

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.510
or lack thereof here.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.030
And what he agreed to participate in

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.200
or his implied participation

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.300
in what the McMichaels intended to do

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.680
will be incredibly crucial here
as to whether Bryan himself

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.680
is a co-conspirator or liable
or guilty of the felony murder

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.660
that may have resulted.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.310
- I can tell you that if we
believe he was a witness,

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.520
we wouldn't have arrested him.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.300
- So Gregory and Travis McMichael

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.560
have been charged with felony murder.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.400
Felony murder is a legal doctrine

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.530
that allows the defendant
to be charged with murder

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.940
for any killing that occurs

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.320
in the course of a dangerous felony,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.660
even if the death is accidental.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.000
For felony murder charges,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.640
there needs to be at least two crimes.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.030
The first crime is a dangerous felony.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.220
A serious or inherently dangerous felony

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.170
can be cruelty to children,
burglary, arson, rape,

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.500
battery, or kidnapping.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.810
And the second crime in a felony murder

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.880
is the death or murder that
results from the crime,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.010
either intentionally or by accident,

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.410
or as a foreseeable result of
the felony being committed.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.160
Now, if you watch a lot
of lawyer or police shows,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.020
you might be thinking now,

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.670
hold on, I thought murder
requires intense and planning.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.410
If the person didn't plan
or intend to murder someone,

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.730
they can't be charged with murder

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.860
because they don't have
the requisite mental state.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.040
Well, that's generally not the case.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.400
Felony murder does not
require intent to kill

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.280
or murder someone,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.600
it only requires the intent to enter

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.890
into that first serious
or dangerous felony.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.730
Therefore accidents attempts and mistakes

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.400
are not a defense to a
felony murder charge.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.930
A person can be guilty of murder

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.570
during the course of a dangerous felony,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.570
even if the person is not the killer.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.750
So if you form a conspiracy

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.390
to commit a serious or dangerous felony,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.820
and you're not even the
one that does the killing,

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.470
but your co-conspirator does,

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.320
you can be held responsible
for the felony murder

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.740
of that other person.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.910
The most common example of this

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.710
is when people try to rob a bank

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.610
and someone dies during the robbery.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.890
Even the getaway driver can
be charged with felony murder.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.190
Even if that person never
sets foot inside the bank,

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.500
didn't intend to kill someone,

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.630
and never pulled the trigger

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.720
that ultimately killed the
person inside the bank.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.490
The rationale is that
without the commission

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.850
of the inherently dangerous felony,

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.920
the murder would not have been committed.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.850
Therefore, the murder is no different

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.890
from the rest of the crime,

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.330
even if it wasn't planned.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.210
And here we have a number of
potentially dangerous felonies

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.800
that might give rise to the
predicate for felony murder.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.500
We have potential kidnapping,

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.310
we have potential assault,

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.410
potential assault with a deadly weapon.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.150
I mean, there's a lot that can happen

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.580
when you go around toting
a shotgun or a pistol

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.270
and start trying to accost
people on the street.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.620
And as we discussed,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.470
the mental state, the premeditation
that is usually required

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.480
for murder is not necessary
in a felony murder context.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.050
But one thing that I've seen bandied

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.600
about is a potential self-defense

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.460
and stand your ground defense.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.390
Now, self-defense could potentially

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.930
be a defense to felony murder.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.610
But Georgia Law says that a
person may only use deadly force

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.000
if they think it's necessary
to prevent their own death

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.827
or "great bodily injury to
themselves or other people,

00:17:27.827 --> 00:17:31.337
"or force is necessary to
prevent a forcible felony

00:17:31.337 --> 00:17:32.540
"such as rape."

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.910
Now, Travis McMichael claims

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.180
that Ahmaud rushed him,

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.050
trying to grab his shotgun
and he feared for his life.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.667
That's what Prosecutor
Barnhill concluded that,

00:17:40.667 --> 00:17:42.967
"given the fact that
Arbery initiated the fight,

00:17:42.967 --> 00:17:45.507
"at the point Arbery grabbed
the shotgun, under Georgia Law,

00:17:45.507 --> 00:17:47.277
"McMichael was allowed to use deadly force

00:17:47.277 --> 00:17:48.400
"to protect himself."

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.460
That's probably not the case.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.300
Lethal force is not justified

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.080
if the person who used deadly
force was the aggressor

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.920
and didn't try to withdraw
from the situation.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.250
Arguably, the McMichaels

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.750
were indeed the aggressors themselves.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.160
Arbery wasn't fleeing or
committing a violent felony.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.110
And arguably, Travis should have withdrawn

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.580
from the situation that he created.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.930
He could have gotten back in the truck,

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.350
he could have walked backwards,

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.780
there's a lot that one can do,

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.770
especially when you're holding a shotgun.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.210
And self-defense also
doesn't apply if the person

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.240
who used the lethal
force initially provoked

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.880
the force being used.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.090
Arguably, the McMichaels might
have provoked the situation

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.543
by driving out in front of Ahmaud Arbery

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.070
with guns and hand
getting out of the truck

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.560
and accosting him.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.070
Even if they were privileged to use force,

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.840
which query whether they were,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.260
it's unlikely that they were
privileged to use deadly force

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.160
when just trying to detain
an individual on the street.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.550
And I've also seen a lot of people talk

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.740
about Georgia's Stand Your Ground law.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.930
Stand Your Ground law is an
extension of the Castle Doctrine

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.770
which allows people in
their homes to use force,

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.160
including deadly force,

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.360
to defend themselves against an intruder.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.193
Now under this law,

00:18:57.193 --> 00:18:59.130
a person doesn't have a duty to retreat

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.030
if they are attacked
inside of their own house.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.210
However, Stand Your Ground
laws are not meant to permit

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.480
a person to initiate a
physical encounter away

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.910
from their home and then
kill their adversary.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.270
You can imagine that
if that were the case,

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.810
then you would always be
incentivized to kill a person

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.000
that you get in a fight with

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.367
because you're standing your ground.

00:19:17.367 --> 00:19:19.410
And the person who died wouldn't be there

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.850
to dispute your side of the story.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:21.980
That's why Stand Your Ground law

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.240
is typically not a valid defense

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.210
when the shooter initiates the encounter

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.020
or is outside of the house.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.760
And even if that defense
did apply to the McDaniels,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.170
you might then assume that it applies

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.580
to Ahmaud Arbery as well

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.750
because he would have had a
right to stand his ground.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.230
The video shows that Arbery was
caught between two vehicles.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.500
He justifiably potentially
feared for his life

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.670
because the McMichaels were
the ones who were armed

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.520
and reaching for his shotgun
was arguably the only way

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.610
that he could save his own life,

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.000
which takes us to the
law of citizen's arrest.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.360
The McMichaels say that their
actions were permissible

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.950
because they were trying to
make a "citizen's arrest."

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.960
Now, most state codes do have
a citizen's arrest statute

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.780
which authorizes a private citizen

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.180
to detain a criminal suspect

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.850
in the absence of law enforcement.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.490
But a citizen's arrest
is greatly misunderstood.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.930
People who are not police

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.350
are not empowered to
act like police officers

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.190
whenever they feel like it.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.200
You can't just roam the
streets looking for criminals

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.033
and then arrest them,

00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:19.150
let alone take them
down with lethal force.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:19.983
And in fact,

00:20:19.983 --> 00:20:20.816
the law only applies

00:20:20.816 --> 00:20:22.730
to a very narrow range of circumstances.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.810
If we look at Georgia's
citizen's arrest statute,

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.643
first of all,

00:20:25.643 --> 00:20:28.220
the person initiating the arrest
needs to have a reasonable

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.710
and probable grounds that
someone committed a crime

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.490
in his or her actual presence,

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.100
or within his or her immediate knowledge.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.980
Second to effectuate a citizen's arrest,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.550
the person can only use reasonable force.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.240
This means that using deadly force

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.210
is usually not reasonable.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.580
And citizen's arrest laws are limited

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.420
because society doesn't
want private citizens

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.120
pursuing vigilante justice.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.540
There's no need for people
to act as law enforcement

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.310
in circumstances where law
enforcement is readily available.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.400
In particular, when you've
already made a call to 911.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.233
Now on this point,

00:20:58.233 --> 00:21:00.610
Prosecutor Barnhill's
letter seems to mix up

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.980
some of the presumptions and requirements

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.730
for the various defenses that
have been levied out there.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.780
But let's talk about the impact

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.810
of a potential trespass by Ahmaud Arbery

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.760
or the impact of potential burglary.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.090
Some people have speculated
that Ahmaud Arbery was guilty

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.890
of something because he
appears on a surveillance video

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.670
of a construction site.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.010
Now, Arbery didn't steal anything.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.420
We know this because the person

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.070
who owns the property confirm
that nothing was stolen.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.470
- I don't want it to be put out

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.780
and misinterpreted for people to think

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.930
that I had accused Mr. Arbery of stealing,

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.920
or robbery because I never did.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.950
- And in the McMichael's
statements to the police,

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.300
they say that they didn't
see Arbery carrying

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.500
anything down the street.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.580
So that likely takes
burglary off the table.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.990
But I guess that doesn't necessarily

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.420
rule out attempted burglary,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.670
if that was in fact what
Mr. Aubrey intended to do,

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.090
though that would be questionable.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.360
But what about trespass?

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.790
In Georgia, a person
commits criminal trespass

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.940
if they, one, intentionally
damage any property

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.470
of another without consent of that person,

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.030
or two, they knowingly and
without authority enter

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.580
onto a person's property
for an unlawful purpose,

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.940
or they enter after the owner
told them entry is forbidden,

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.900
or three, they remain on the
premises after receiving notice

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.240
from the owner that they should leave.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.190
Now, none of these circumstances
appear to apply here.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.300
There was no property damage or theft.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.040
At this point, there's no
evidence that Arbery walked

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.740
through the site for an unlawful purpose,

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.750
nor was he previously told to leave.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.320
And in fact, it appears that
other people besides Ahmaud

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.250
were on this property doing
sort of exactly the same thing.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:41.950
But even if it were the case

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.410
that Ahmaud Arbery had
committed criminal trespass,

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:46.360
under these circumstances,

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.240
it would be a minor
misdemeanor under Georgia Law.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.010
And for very good reasons,

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.810
the law does not permit
someone to use deadly force

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.320
to detain someone who has
committed a misdemeanor.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.610
It probably doesn't even allow the police

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.210
to use deadly force in
that particular situation.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.360
And of course, there are very
good public policy reasons

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.580
why this is the case.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.360
We probably as a society
shouldn't be comfortable

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.850
with basically sentencing
some people to death

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.810
for misdemeanor violations.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.270
You can't start firing at people

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.480
for jaywalking across the street.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.320
And then finally,

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.220
the other defense that I see bandied about

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.980
in support of the McMichaels
in this particular case,

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.730
is that Greg McMichael
was effectively deputized

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.270
by the police to take
exactly this kind of action.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.770
And in fact, Georgia
TV station is reporting

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.140
that Greg McDaniel is the one

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.120
who leaked the cell phone video believing

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.070
it would mobilize people to his side.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.580
- [Reporter] Confirmed today
that it was Gregory McMichael,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.990
Travis's father,

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.270
who gave the video to a radio station.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.890
- [Reporter] And Tucker
hoped when the video showed

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.040
what actually occurred,

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.717
it with ease racial
tensions in the community.

00:23:47.717 --> 00:23:50.020
"I didn't want the neighborhood
to become a Ferguson,"

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.853
he said.

00:23:50.853 --> 00:23:52.850
- Of course, the video has
had the opposite effect,

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.420
mainly sparking anger and controversy.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.090
But evidently, Larry
English who owned the house

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.150
that Ahmaud Arbery potentially
visited in February

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.350
before he was killed

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.730
and reached out to police
in December of 2019.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.010
And in response to
Larry English's inquiry,

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:13.360
Officer Robert Rash said on
December 20th, 2019 Greg,

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.610
meaning Greg McMichael is
retired law enforcement

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.870
and also a retired investigator
for the DA's office.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.140
Rash also included
McMichael's phone number

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.417
and conveyed the message
that McMichael said,

00:24:24.417 --> 00:24:25.917
"Please call him day or night

00:24:25.917 --> 00:24:28.316
"when you get action on your camera."

00:24:28.316 --> 00:24:30.041
- And my cameras might well, notify me

00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:32.210
and let me know somebody
was on the property.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.610
- As far as I can tell,

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.880
this does not have the effect

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.810
of deputizing a private citizen

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.030
to act as police law
enforcement in a private matter.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.580
There's no such thing as
being effectively deputized.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.480
This isn't an old west movie.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.410
This doesn't have the effect
of giving Greg McMichael

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.310
any additional privilege
to use deadly force

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.090
or even to use regular force,

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.960
or reasonable force in the first instance.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.530
It doesn't really have
any effect on what he can

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.550
and cannot do in this
particular situation.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.240
Now, there's no happy ending here.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.350
There's no pithy segue.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.530
If we've learned anything here,

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.650
it's that we need to
make the most of life.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.810
And one of the best ways of
doing that is with Skillshare.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.310
I've long been a fan of the fact

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.550
that you can learn almost
anything on Skillshare

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.370
and we can all try and find a little piece

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.680
through intentional living,

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.340
like with Erin Boyle's
class, Everyday Minimalism.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.040
Find calm and creativity in living simply.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.480
In her class, Erin teaches
you how living with less

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.530
can unlock a life of more energy savings

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.380
and more time to do the
things that you love.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.760
It's a great way to beautify your home

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.430
by calling what you already own

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.650
because we're spending so
much time at home these days.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.120
And when I went down this rabbit hole,

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.710
I also really enjoyed architect
Donald Ratner's class,

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.290
using design psychology
to maximize creativity

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.470
at home and at work.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.620
There are just so many
great classes on Skillshare

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.770
because Skillshare is an
online learning community

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.370
that has tens of thousands
of classes on everything,

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.980
like music, design,
technology, and business.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.570
A yearly membership is
less than $10 per month,

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.883
but the first 1000 LegalEagles

00:25:55.883 --> 00:25:57.630

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.120
and learn new things,

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.320

everything that's relevant

for your understanding.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.843
