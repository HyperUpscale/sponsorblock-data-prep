00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:55.100 align:start position:0%
it should have been called something
 

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.610 align:start position:0%
it should have been called something
like<00:17:55.160><c> a</c><00:17:55.580><c> 35</c><00:17:56.420><c> 50</c><00:17:56.750><c> or</c><00:17:56.840><c> whatever</c><00:17:57.140><c> they</c><00:17:57.410><c> could</c><00:17:57.530><c> have</c>

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:57.620 align:start position:0%
like a 35 50 or whatever they could have
 

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.010 align:start position:0%

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:12.620 align:start position:0%
production is yes they did continue it's
 

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
production is yes they did continue it's
just<00:18:12.800><c> that</c><00:18:12.920><c> it's</c><00:18:13.070><c> sort</c><00:18:13.220><c> of</c><00:18:13.280><c> in</c><00:18:13.370><c> a</c><00:18:13.430><c> weird</c><00:18:13.670><c> way</c>

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:13.730 align:start position:0%
just that it's sort of in a weird way
 

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.550 align:start position:0%
just that it's sort of in a weird way
and<00:18:14.120><c> that</c><00:18:14.420><c> they</c><00:18:14.540><c> made</c><00:18:14.690><c> it</c><00:18:14.780><c> better</c><00:18:14.930><c> for</c><00:18:15.020><c> cheaper</c>

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:15.560 align:start position:0%

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.070 align:start position:0%
so it's not really continued but because
 

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.130 align:start position:0%
so it's not really continued but because

00:31:46.919 --> 00:31:46.929 align:start position:0%
especially is one of trying to figure
 

00:31:46.929 --> 00:31:50.999 align:start position:0%
especially is one of trying to figure
out<00:31:46.989><c> how</c><00:31:47.409><c> do</c><00:31:47.469><c> I</c><00:31:48.959><c> produce</c><00:31:49.959><c> more</c><00:31:50.289><c> content</c><00:31:50.559><c> and</c>

00:31:50.999 --> 00:31:51.009 align:start position:0%
out how do I produce more content and
 

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:53.579 align:start position:0%
out how do I produce more content and
Patrick<00:31:51.639><c> has</c><00:31:51.819><c> been</c><00:31:52.629><c> involved</c><00:31:53.049><c> in</c><00:31:53.079><c> this</c><00:31:53.199><c> deeply</c>

00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:53.589 align:start position:0%
Patrick has been involved in this deeply
 

00:31:53.589 --> 00:31:55.949 align:start position:0%
Patrick has been involved in this deeply
too<00:31:53.739><c> so</c><00:31:54.579><c> really</c><00:31:55.089><c> it's</c><00:31:55.209><c> at</c><00:31:55.419><c> this</c><00:31:55.629><c> point</c><00:31:55.839><c> is</c><00:31:55.899><c> how</c>

00:31:55.949 --> 00:31:55.959 align:start position:0%
too so really it's at this point is how
 

00:31:55.959 --> 00:31:57.689 align:start position:0%
too so really it's at this point is how
do<00:31:56.019><c> we</c><00:31:56.109><c> Patrick</c><00:31:56.739><c> and</c><00:31:56.829><c> I</c><00:31:56.859><c> produce</c><00:31:57.399><c> enough</c>

00:31:57.689 --> 00:31:57.699 align:start position:0%
do we Patrick and I produce enough
 

00:31:57.699 --> 00:31:59.459 align:start position:0%
do we Patrick and I produce enough
content<00:31:58.149><c> to</c><00:31:58.299><c> saturate</c><00:31:58.779><c> the</c><00:31:58.809><c> video</c><00:31:59.079><c> production</c>

00:31:59.459 --> 00:31:59.469 align:start position:0%
content to saturate the video production
 

00:31:59.469 --> 00:32:01.229 align:start position:0%
content to saturate the video production
schedule<00:31:59.979><c> so</c><00:32:00.519><c> that</c><00:32:00.609><c> everyone's</c><00:32:00.939><c> got</c><00:32:01.029><c> enough</c>

00:32:01.229 --> 00:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
schedule so that everyone's got enough
 

00:32:01.239 --> 00:32:05.549 align:start position:0%
schedule so that everyone's got enough
hours<00:32:01.569><c> for</c><00:32:01.779><c> the</c><00:32:01.839><c> week</c><00:32:01.989><c> and</c><00:32:03.959><c> that</c><00:32:04.959><c> alone</c><00:32:05.499><c> is</c>

00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
hours for the week and that alone is
 

00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:08.689 align:start position:0%
hours for the week and that alone is
such<00:32:06.369><c> an</c><00:32:06.609><c> enormous</c><00:32:06.879><c> amount</c><00:32:07.329><c> of</c><00:32:07.539><c> stress</c><00:32:07.869><c> and</c>

00:32:08.689 --> 00:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
such an enormous amount of stress and
 

00:32:08.699 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
such an enormous amount of stress and
just<00:32:09.699><c> I</c><00:32:09.909><c> mean</c><00:32:09.999><c> it's</c><00:32:10.329><c> constantly</c><00:32:11.789><c> shuffling</c>

00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:12.789 align:start position:0%
just I mean it's constantly shuffling
 

00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
just I mean it's constantly shuffling
schedules<00:32:13.359><c> and</c><00:32:13.949><c> moving</c><00:32:14.949><c> stuff</c><00:32:15.129><c> around</c>

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:15.369 align:start position:0%

cutting corners sometimes when you don't
want<00:32:17.709><c> to</c><00:32:17.949><c> it's</c><00:32:18.759><c> hard</c><00:32:18.969><c> I</c><00:32:19.449><c> don't</c><00:32:19.929><c> want</c><00:32:20.349><c> to</c><00:32:20.679><c> scale</c>

00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
want to it's hard I don't want to scale
 

00:32:20.919 --> 00:32:23.069 align:start position:0%
want to it's hard I don't want to scale
that<00:32:21.129><c> problem</c><00:32:21.579><c> up</c><00:32:21.759><c> right</c><00:32:22.359><c> now</c><00:32:22.509><c> I've</c><00:32:22.689><c> got</c><00:32:22.869><c> I</c>

00:32:23.069 --> 00:32:23.079 align:start position:0%
that problem up right now I've got I
 

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
that problem up right now I've got I
figured<00:32:23.649><c> it</c><00:32:23.739><c> out</c><00:32:23.799><c> I've</c><00:32:23.979><c> got</c><00:32:24.129><c> a</c><00:32:24.159><c> pretty</c><00:32:24.309><c> good</c>

00:32:24.479 --> 00:32:24.489 align:start position:0%
figured it out I've got a pretty good
 

00:32:24.489 --> 00:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
figured it out I've got a pretty good
handle<00:32:24.639><c> on</c><00:32:24.879><c> it</c><00:32:25.469><c> as</c><00:32:26.469><c> long</c><00:32:26.529><c> as</c><00:32:26.709><c> I</c><00:32:26.829><c> can</c><00:32:26.889><c> work</c><00:32:27.069><c> the</c>

00:32:27.239 --> 00:32:27.249 align:start position:0%
handle on it as long as I can work the
 

00:32:27.249 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
handle on it as long as I can work the
hours<00:32:27.369><c> I'm</c><00:32:27.669><c> doing</c><00:32:27.969><c> then</c><00:32:28.359><c> we're</c><00:32:28.539><c> good</c><00:32:28.689><c> at</c><00:32:29.379><c> some</c>

00:32:29.639 --> 00:32:29.649 align:start position:0%
hours I'm doing then we're good at some
 

00:32:29.649 --> 00:32:30.839 align:start position:0%
hours I'm doing then we're good at some
point<00:32:29.859><c> I'd</c><00:32:29.979><c> probably</c><00:32:30.159><c> would</c><00:32:30.399><c> want</c><00:32:30.639><c> to</c><00:32:30.729><c> bring</c>

00:32:30.839 --> 00:32:30.849 align:start position:0%
point I'd probably would want to bring
 

00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
point I'd probably would want to bring
on<00:32:30.969><c> another</c><00:32:31.149><c> content</c><00:32:31.719><c> production</c><00:32:31.899><c> side</c>

on another content production side
someone<00:32:33.039><c> who</c><00:32:33.459><c> could</c><00:32:33.639><c> do</c><00:32:34.059><c> some</c><00:32:34.209><c> of</c><00:32:34.239><c> the</c><00:32:34.329><c> writing</c>

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:34.629 align:start position:0%
someone who could do some of the writing
 

00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:39.269 align:start position:0%
someone who could do some of the writing
but<00:32:34.779><c> not</c><00:32:35.049><c> yet</c><00:32:35.319><c> so</c><00:32:36.479><c> the</c><00:32:37.479><c> question</c><00:32:37.899><c> of</c><00:32:38.219><c> how</c><00:32:39.219><c> do</c>

00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
but not yet so the question of how do
 

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
but not yet so the question of how do
you<00:32:39.399><c> scale</c><00:32:39.669><c> the</c><00:32:39.939><c> other</c><00:32:40.059><c> thing</c><00:32:40.269><c> that's</c><00:32:40.389><c> kind</c><00:32:40.569><c> of</c>

00:32:40.679 --> 00:32:40.689 align:start position:0%
you scale the other thing that's kind of
 

00:32:40.689 --> 00:32:41.999 align:start position:0%
you scale the other thing that's kind of
challenging<00:32:40.839><c> for</c><00:32:41.169><c> me</c><00:32:41.259><c> too</c><00:32:41.409><c> is</c><00:32:41.559><c> I've</c><00:32:41.799><c> always</c>

00:32:41.999 --> 00:32:42.009 align:start position:0%
challenging for me too is I've always
 

00:32:42.009 --> 00:32:44.309 align:start position:0%
challenging for me too is I've always

been a min/max er with RTS is what I
 

00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:46.469 align:start position:0%
been a min/max er with RTS is what I
