there's<00:14:50.170><c> like</c><00:14:50.350><c> every</c><00:14:51.070><c> scene</c><00:14:51.580><c> they</c><00:14:51.910><c> would</c><00:14:52.120><c> put</c>

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:52.390 align:start position:0%
there's like every scene they would put
 

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
there's like every scene they would put
the<00:14:52.510><c> camera</c><00:14:52.900><c> in</c><00:14:52.990><c> the</c><00:14:53.080><c> most</c><00:14:53.580><c> interesting</c><00:14:54.580><c> place</c>

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:54.850 align:start position:0%
the camera in the most interesting place
 

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.970 align:start position:0%
the camera in the most interesting place
even<00:14:55.180><c> if</c><00:14:55.300><c> it</c><00:14:55.450><c> didn't</c><00:14:55.810><c> really</c><00:14:56.050><c> call</c><00:14:56.380><c> for</c><00:14:56.620><c> it</c><00:14:56.770><c> but</c>

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:56.980 align:start position:0%
even if it didn't really call for it but
 

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
even if it didn't really call for it but
I<00:14:57.220><c> guess</c><00:14:57.520><c> the</c><00:14:57.700><c> the</c><00:14:57.970><c> implication</c><00:14:58.480><c> is</c><00:14:58.540><c> that</c><00:14:58.600><c> if</c>

00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:58.990 align:start position:0%
I guess the the implication is that if
 

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.150 align:start position:0%
I guess the the implication is that if
there's<00:14:59.200><c> hidden</c><00:14:59.380><c> cameras</c><00:14:59.770><c> everywhere</c><00:15:00.010><c> and</c>
