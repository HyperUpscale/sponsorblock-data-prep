00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
keep up with a surging intel and then
 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.310 align:start position:0%
keep up with a surging intel and then

because while great graphics are great
obviously<00:10:53.040><c> at</c><00:10:53.200><c> a</c><00:10:53.279><c> certain</c><00:10:53.600><c> point</c><00:10:53.920><c> they're</c>

00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
obviously at a certain point they're
 

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:55.110 align:start position:0%
obviously at a certain point they're

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
and at that point you can sink so much
 

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.470 align:start position:0%
and at that point you can sink so much
