00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.929
It would’ve flown nearly three times the
speed of sound and carry more than 250 passengers

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.370
the distance from New York to Los Angeles
in under two hours.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.160
Its development was backed by a billion in
U.S. government funding and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.250
an army of Boeing engineers.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.670
And airlines were lining up to buy it.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:41.500
This, would’ve been America’s answer to
Concorde.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.440
The 1960's was a decade marked by relentless
optimism for the future.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.440
Laser beams, satellites, and moon landings.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.650
This was a decade in which the world was changing
quickly.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.450
In just a few short years, propeller driven
aircraft had been replaced by sleek new jetliners.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.500
And while this new jet age was exciting, many
were expecting an even bigger leap forward.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.009
Air travel, was about to get a whole lot faster.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:15.400
A 1950's propeller driven airliner could take
15 hours to fly from New York to London.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.280
In the 1960's, a jet made that same flight
in around seven hours.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.810
But many were expecting that by the 1970's,
supersonic transports would begin

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.930
replacing jets.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.590
And they would fly two or even three times
the speed of jetliners.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.440
And that would cut a New York to London flight
down to under three hours.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.310
By the end of the 1970's, hundreds of these
supersonic transports were expected

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.610
to be flying.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.360
And nearly every major American aircraft manufacturer
was dreaming up plans for them.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.250
But these were still very much, just plans.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.900
Because actually building a supersonic transport
was an enormous challenge.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.140
The technological hurdles alone, were daunting.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.810
But supersonic transports wouldn't just need
to fly fast, they’d need to be economical

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.950
enough for airlines to actually operate.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.110
And these same airlines were already buying
American made jetliners.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.580
U.S. manufacturers had the commercial aviation
market, pretty much cornered.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.200
So there wasn’t the will to invest the massive
sums of money needed to get any of these plans

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.700
off the ground.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.660
But across the Atlantic, the British and French
weren’t waiting around.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.859
In 1962, the two countries announced a partnership
to build Concorde, and this marked the first

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.560
serious effort to actually build a supersonic
airliner.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.080
And a few months later, the Soviets also jumped
into the race with their Tupolev 144.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.049
The Americans had been keeping an eye on the
Concorde program well before 1962.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.010
Over the years, they watched the program transform
from a concept to a serious enterprise.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.239
And that began to worry American officials.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.749
Because if the British and French would be
the first to open up the supersonic transport

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:06.410
market, and do so uncontested, well, that
could seriously threaten America’s lead

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.480
in civil Aviation.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.780
Thousands of aerospace jobs could be at stake.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.819
A future American President might one day
be forced to fly around in a foreign built

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.940
supersonic transport.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.459
And airlines, were now also beginning to show
interest.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.689
Pan American World Airways, at the time the
largest American international carrier, even

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.769
announced its intention to buy Concordes.

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.030
So in 1963, the race was on.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.799
President Kennedy announced that the U.S.
government would help fund the development

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.330
of an American supersonic transport.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.459
Manufacturers were invited to participate
in a design competition which outlined an

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.780
ambitious set of goals.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.449
Develop an aircraft considerably faster and
larger than Concorde, with economics comparable

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.120
to regular subsonic jets.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.359
Just as ambitious were the design proposals
from the three participating American manufacturers.

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:08.449
But after years of evaluation, it was Boeing’s
design that was ultimately chosen in 1967.

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:13.019
And this was Boeing’s design entry, the
2707.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.690
It would fly considerably faster than Concorde,
and that introduced a whole slew of technical

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.180
challenges requiring some pretty radical solutions.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.020
Like all supersonic transports, the Boeing
2707’s shape was highly streamlined.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.569
But it also featured something unheard for
a plane it’s size.

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.220
A variable geometry wing.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.460
During landing and takeoff, the 2707’s wings
would be pivoted forward to allow for lower

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.470
flight speeds and increased control.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.490
During supersonic cruise, its wings would
be swept back to counter the massive aerodynamic

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.240
drag it would experience as it approached
three times the speed of sound.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.630
The 2707 would be powered by four Turbojets
fitted with afterburners.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.690
To counter the heat they generated, they were
uniquely positioned under the aircraft at

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.760
the rear.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.009
But this this made the plane rear heavy.

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.699
And that meant the 2707 needed an extra set
of landing gear.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.930
Because it would cruise considerably faster
than Concorde, atmospheric friction would

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.090
heat the 2707’s exterior to several hundred
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.030
Temperatures hot enough to soften regular
aircraft aluminum.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.430
So Boeing would need to build the fuselage
out of titanium, with components and systems

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.979
all specially designed to withstand the enormous
heat.

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.870
And it would fly much higher than a typical
jet, which meant more pressurization.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.569
Hence the tiny cabin windows which were only
six inches.

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.379
Luckily for passengers, the 2707 would feature
an advanced in-flight entertainment system

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.870
with a cabin full of televisions.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.229
Boeing was confident that the 2707 could enter
service with airlines, by the mid-1970’s.

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.250
But this plane was pushing 1960's technology
way beyond its limits.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.039
It wasn't even close to being ready.

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:11.980
To start, the titanium alloy needed for the
2707’s airframe was expensive and difficult

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.290
to work with.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.290
The swing-wing mechanism was complex and enormously
heavy.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.349
It wasn't going to work, and eventually, Boeing
was forced back to the drawing board, designing

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.539
a plane with a more conventional delta wing,
like Concorde.

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.789
But even as Boeing struggled to work through
massive engineering hurdles, there was an

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.070
even bigger problem.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.490
At supersonic speeds, aircraft generate loud
sonic booms that can be heard along the entire

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.599
supersonic flight path.

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:48.370
A Boeing 2707 cruising at 60 thousand feet
would produce a sonic boom heard as much as

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.479
30 miles away.

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:54.979
It was estimated that a single transcontinental
flight would produce sonic booms heard by

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.389
over 5 million people.

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:02.990
And to see just how tolerant people were,
in 1964, the good people of Oklahoma City

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:09.120
were to subjected six months of daily sonic
boom testing by the FAA and Air Force.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.469
With supersonic jets regularly flying overhead,
booms cracked windows on two of the city’s

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:15.900
tallest buildings.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.340
The tests were forced to end early.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.699
More than 15 thousand residents filed complaints
and a further 5 thousand made claims

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:24.699
for property damage.

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:29.659
A full quarter of the city’s residents claimed
they couldn't tolerate living with the noise.

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:35.990
The Oklahoma boom tests happened only months
after America’s Supersonic effort was announced.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.789
But it was one of many warning signs that
officials seemed unwilling to acknowledge.

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:45.819
Practical realities were put on hold, because
the competitiveness of America’s aviation

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:49.479
industry and national pride remained at stake.

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:54.680
But as the 1960s wore on, the program was
plagued by technical setbacks.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.050
The ambitious program requirements were not
being met, and an anti-SST movement had grown

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.349
from a handful of concerned citizens to a
major national coalition of

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:07.060
environmental organizations.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.409
Growing public opposition to sonic booms had
spread to other kinds of other fears.

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:16.460
Some worried that hundreds of supersonic airliners
flying at high altitude would emit enough

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.520
nitrogen oxide to destroy the ozone layer.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.400
They painted a picture of a dystopian future,
where exhaust gases and water vapor would

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.659
cover the earth in a permanent haze.

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:30.450
In 1969, Nixon took over the presidency.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:36.240
By this point America’s Supersonic Transport
Program was delayed by years, its budget ballooning

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.300
out of control, and the public’s enthusiasm
wavering.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.540
Two comprehensive reviews commissioned by
the government questioned the future viability

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.960
of supersonic transports, and recommended
ending public funding for the program.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.750
So now, it was on President Nixon’ shoulders
to make the difficult decision.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.500
For fifty years, the United States has lead
the world in air transport.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.250
The decision that we announce today means
that we will continue maintain leadership

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.290
in this field.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.310
The supersonic transport is going to be built.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:15.420
But by this point, many could see that the
Boeing 2707’s days were clearly numbered.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.320
With a worsening economic situation in the
United States, the program was quickly becoming

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.340
a contentious political issue.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:29.850
In 1971 the U.S Senate rejected any further
funding for the project and the Boeing 2707

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.140
officially died.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.500
Two years later, the FAA banned all civil
supersonic aviation over the United States

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.210
due to sonic boom noise concerns, greatly
impacting the sales potential of the Concorde,

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.060
and the viability of any future supersonic
transport.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:51.760
During the 1960’s many had predicted that
hundreds of SSTs would fly the skies within

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.450
the coming decades.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:59.230
While the Concorde flew many years, only 14
were ever delivered to just two airlines.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:05.970
The Soviet Union’s TU-144 only flew regular
passenger service for 8 months

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:06.970
on a single route.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:11.650
When the 2707 project was canceled, the threat
of foreign competition and concerns about

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:17.140
national prestige were no longer great enough
to offset political, economic and

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.140
environmental pressures.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.220
The public’s view of government programs
and optimism over technology had waned.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.390
Over the course of the 1960’s the world
had clearly changed.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.880

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.870
I’ve been a huge Audible fan for years.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:52.550
Especially now, between producing these videos,
my day job, and the rest of my life, I really

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.130
don't have time to sit down and read.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.130
So I don’t.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.140
Instead, I listen to Audible.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.680
Because with Audible, I can still enjoy fantastic
books by listening to them during my commute

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.090
to work, while cleaning the house, or even
while editing YouTube videos.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:13.040
Recently, I’ve been listening to Karl Marlantes
Matterhorn. It's a gripping story that follows

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.220
a company of marines during the Vietnam War.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.800
This book drops you right into the thick of
a terrifying jungle.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.130
And I’ve got to say, I found the experience
to be visceral.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.550
Marlantes does an incredible job detailing
the complex and grueling experience

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.550
of the marines.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.170
The futility of their mission, the horrifying
sights, sounds and smells, and their frustration

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:39.010
over a chain of command that has no clue about
what happening on the ground.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.230
I highly recommend checking this book out.
