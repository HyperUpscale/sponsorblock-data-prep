00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
- Howdy GREG!

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:01.840
I hope you're all having a great day!

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.370
Welcome back to another episode

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.610
of TikTok Time!

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.520
Talk about TikToks!

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.790
One of the things that is most
interesting for me to watch

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.010
as social media becomes
more and more popular,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.610
is like the blending of traditional media,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.010
like TV and movies and social media.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.400
I think its really cool and interesting

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.040
to see social media stars,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.940
like YouTubers and
Instagrammers getting roles

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.600
in major TV shows.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.130
Even getting their own shows.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.160
Appearing in movies,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.390
or even starting like huge music careers.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.380
But I think the flip side of
that is just as interesting.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.110
Seeing traditional celebrities,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.270
people who got their
start on mainstream media

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.550
trying to establish a
presence on social media.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.520
Over the past couple of years,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.950
we've seen a decent amount of celebrities

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.890
start YouTube channels.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.880
One of the weird things

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.650
I've noticed though is that while

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.660
it's taken like over a decade

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.790
it seems like for traditional celebrities

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.380
to start getting on YouTube.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.260
It's only taken like two
years for every celebrity ever

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.790
to want to get on TikTok.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.660
I don't know what it is,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.810
I feel like I blinked

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.830
and now every single musician and actor

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.840
and comedian is on TikTok now.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.840
I don't know why.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.070
But it's interesting to look at,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.230
'cause I feel lately there's
been a lot of conversations

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.320
about YouTubers in mainstream media

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.080
and how well they're adapting.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.640
Likewise, I think that a lot
of mainstream media celebrities

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.110
are having a similar issue with going

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.630
from traditional media like
hosting a talk show to TikTok.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.120
'Cause a lot of the celebrities on TikTok

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.080
are not very good at TikTok.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.250
So I tweeted a couple of days ago

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.330
asking who are some of the
best and worst examples

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.790
of mainstream celebrities
transitioning over to TikTok.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.340
So I wanted to go over a few of them today

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.760
and take a look at what makes
a good celebrity on TikTok.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.840
Who is doing it well, and
who should get the boot!

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.700
Who needs to be kicked off TikTok?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.540
Not all celebrities

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.110
who have started TikTok accounts are bad.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.290
I think two pretty good
examples are Finn Wolfhard

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.123
and Noah Schnapp.

00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:45.070
You will recognize these dudes

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.490
if you ever watched Stranger Things,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.750
and to me it seems like
they both joined TikTok

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.970
just 'cause they wanted to

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.200
and 'cause they like TikTok

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.110
and they make TikToks
that they think are funny.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.890
They hop on all the popular trends,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.250
put their own little twists on it,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.130
and a lot of their TikToks

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.040
are them just goofing
around in their house.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.350
A lot of Noah's TikToks
are him without a shirt on,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.380
which is a little odd,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.213
but all in all,

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:05.510
a lot of them have like
that very Vine like quality

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.760
where they are just sort of off the cuff

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.000
just a dude sitting in
his room making videos.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.280
Another celebrity that I think
does a good job on TikTok

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.410
is Charli XCX.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.030
I'm not really a huge fan of her music,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.290
I don't really even
think that I could name

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.180
any of her songs,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.870
but I know that she is pretty famous.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.950
She's got a lot of fans.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.360
Her TikToks are a lot
different than Finn and Noah's.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.120
They are...

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.000
They're chaos.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.010
They're pure chaos.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.340
That's the only way to describe it,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.640
but I've come to realize that

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.420
that's what TikTok is all about.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.780
It's about being chaotic,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.890
unhinged and completely unreasonable.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.666
You can't give a fuck on TikTok.

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:41.083
(club music)

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.100
So this is the first TikTok
that I saw of Charlie XCX,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.610
and you know at first you might
be like, "Wow that sucked."

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.750
But, hear me out.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.640
One of the most annoying
things celebrities do on TikTok

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.330
is just get on and try to promote

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.600
whatever they're working on.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.920
If it's like a movie,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.760
they're always on set showing it off.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.980
If they're in like a TV show,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.880
they're always like showing
behind the scene stuff,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.300
and it really just feels like a ploy

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.040
to get you to watch the
show that they're on.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.890
This is just Charli XCX,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.157
I don't know like in a hotel room, and-

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:13.380
(club music)

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.170
I like don't know what she's doing,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.980
but at least she's not
promoting something.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.830
- Oop!

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.489
- Now here's another one of her TikToks.

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.739
♪ This girl is on fire ♪

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:26.650
(laughs)

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.080
Uh, so yeah.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.440
That's it, that's the whole TikTok.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.830
It's just Charli popping up on the screen.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.750
Alicia Keys, Girl on Fire,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.470
and Charli not being on fire.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.270
A simple concept, a simple execution,

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.510
but honestly, I'm vibing with it.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.280
It's not like the most
genius thing in the world,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.370
but she's just being silly,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.850
and that's one of the big appeals

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.550
I feel like for most people on TikTok

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.020
is they just want to be silly.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.170
They just want to be goofy,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.310
and Charli XCX is a goofball.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.620
And so for that reason,
I'm giving her a thumbs up!

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.950
She's not getting the boot.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:58.890
She's getting the thumb.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.580
I feel like Post Malone
does a really good job

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.520
on TikTok too.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.420
I quite like this TikTok of his.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.290
Where is seems like he's in a club,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.020
and his song is playing in the background.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.050
So it could be perceived

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.780
as like he is trying to promote his song,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.150
but the TikTok is not even about that.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.250
He's just in the club with a
comically large box of money.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.570
Just handing out gigantic stacks

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.490
of $1 dollar bills to people.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.485
- [Man] Let me get one!

00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:24.570
(background club music)

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.840
- And you only see Post
Malone in this TikTok,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.460
but I've got to imagine there's
just like a huge line-up

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.920
of people just waiting in line at the club

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.790
to get their money.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.530
Oh wait, that's not just one box of money.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.810
That's two giant boxes of money.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.210
He's got two giant boxes full of money

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.043
that he's handing out.

00:04:42.043 --> 00:04:43.710
- Let me get one!

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.543
(static interruption)

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:46.160
I think the reason I
like this TikTok so much

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.600
is because it's just plain silly.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.540
I like the absurdity of the situation.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.560
I like how happy Post Malone looks,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.190
and I like that he moves like a sloth.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.500
Okay, now I'd like to move on

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.330
to an example that I don't
really know how to feel about.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.740
In the script for this video

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.230
where I've written down all the accounts

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.063
I want to talk about,

00:05:01.063 --> 00:05:03.910
I've got like "the good"
and then "the bad",

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.560
and then I had to make a
separate section in the middle

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.490
called "the okay" for
this particular person,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.240
and that person is Howie Mandel.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.390
In every technical way,
he is very bad at TikTok.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.680
Every time he tries to hop on a trend,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.350
or do a popular dance,

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.770
or use a popular sound,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.970
he just doesn't know how to do it.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.803
He can't.

00:05:23.803 --> 00:05:25.090
He's physically incapable

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.730
of getting a single challenge right,

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.110
but it also seems like he's aware of this

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.130
and is kind of doing it ironically,

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.110
but even still I can't decide

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.930
if using the excuse of like
"I'm doing it ironically"

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.370
makes his TikToks good.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.900
Like there's this one where
he just puts frozen yogurt

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.240
all over his bald head

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.870
and then looks around
all sad and disappointed,

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.660
and like yeah it's funny,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.850
but also, what the fuck?

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.651
All right, enough about Howie Mandel,

00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:50.880
the okay TikToker.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.370
It's time to talk about "the bad."

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.540
Okay, so someone tweeting me
this TikTok by Fall Out Boy.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.820
Fall Out Boy's TikTok is weird

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.203
'cause they've only posted three TikToks.

00:05:58.203 --> 00:06:01.580
They've posted two way back in 2017,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.100
and then took a two year long break

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.430
and then posted another
one just a few months ago,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.920
and there could not be less
effort put into their TikToks.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.670
The first one from 2017,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.670
which is the one that this person sent me,

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.770
is just Pete Wentz asking people
to listen to their new song

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.290
and make TikToks with it.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.210
- What's up? Pete from Fall Out Boy here,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.127
and we just put out our brand new song,

00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:25.240
"Young and Menace."

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.480
We want to see your musicals to it, so-

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.480
- Him sitting on the couch
in the middle of the TikTok

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.700
makes it seem like he got too tired

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.290
from the minimal amount of effort

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.900
that he was putting into the TikTok.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.850
Hey guys, Pete from Fall Out Boy...

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.650
Ah fuck, I've got to sit.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.620
I've got to sit down.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.329
Please listen to our new song.

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:44.162
- What's up?

00:06:44.162 --> 00:06:45.810
- Also it's weird that
he's calling them musicals.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.920
He's like, "Please make a
musical for our new song."

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.753
- Your musicals.

00:06:49.753 --> 00:06:51.330
- Why is he calling them musicals?

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.300
Hey guys, please write a
full three hour long musical

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.470
to our new song.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.750
It's only three minutes long,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.470
but please turn it into
a full length musical.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.303
Thanks guys.

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:01.281
To be fair,

00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:03.060
I think that was when
TikTok was still musically,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.430
so, I guess it would make
more sense in that context.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.470
Were musicallies called musicals?

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.550
That's a weird name.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.400
That would be like if Vines
were called feature films.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.830
Looping feature films.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.270
So then the next thing they posted

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.650
was a snippet from their
music video of that song,

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.210
and then they just went
silent for like two years.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.450
Radio silence, and then came
back just a couple months ago

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.465
with this TikTok.

00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:26.298
(loud rock music)

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.700
It's such a weird attempt
to try to market your song,

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.210
but put the least amount
of effort into it possible.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.770
Also why is the caption, "Puppy Pranks?"

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.860
How is this a prank on the dogs?

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.360
Ha! You stupid dog.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.490
You thought we were going to the dog park?

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.440
Nah son.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.920
We're going to the fucking club.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.500
Yeah, you can tell that the
dogs know they got pranked.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.900
Look at the looks on their faces.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.350
They know they've been duped.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.380
(rock music)

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.050
But speaking of putting minimal effort

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.270
into promoting your music,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.590
you want to know who else has a TikTok?

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.560
Justin Bieber.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.210
Now I don't want to talk too
much about Justin Bieber,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.700
because I've already made an entire video

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.000
talking about how poorly
he marketed, "Yummy."

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.280
So I'm just going to say this,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.110
Justin Bieber has made 11 TikToks,

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.840
and do you want to know how many of them

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.537
used the song "Yummy?"

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.810
Ten.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.643
Ten of them.

00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:19.020
Only one of his TikToks
is not promoting Yummy,

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.750
and the one that's not promoting Yummy

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.640
is promoting his clothing
line "Drew House."

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.520
So like I said before,

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.300
since there's been a
lot of discussion around

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.380
social media stars going to TV,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.290
like Lily Singh getting
a late night talk show,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.630
let's look at an example of
a late night talk show host

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.480
getting a TikTok.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.973
So somebody sent me Jimmy Fallon's TikTok.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.410
I'm excited.

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.520
- Snail. Jellyfish.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.583
Snail. Jellyfish.

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:46.130
(door unlocks)

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.963
Snail. Jellyfish.

00:08:46.963 --> 00:08:47.993
- Right off the bat,

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.370
I don't even know what the
concept of this TikTok is.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.180
I don't know why Jimmy is
like faking out a door handle

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.770
with the snail jellyfish thing.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.970
- I've got these guys
up here in this video.

00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:01.156
What's up dude?

00:09:01.156 --> 00:09:02.020
- What's up.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.475
- Snail. Jellyfish.

00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:05.010
(man laughs)

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.900
- This is like the most
timid prank I've ever seen.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.777
Jimmy Fallon is like a prank TikToker,

00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:13.440
but he is like so nervous and shy.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.658
I'm going to get these guys up here.

00:09:14.658 --> 00:09:16.010
I'm going to get them pretty good.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.843
Hey man, what's up?

00:09:16.843 --> 00:09:18.100
Snail. Jellyfish.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.340
(shy laughter)

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.173
- [Woman] How's it going?

00:09:20.173 --> 00:09:21.326
- Snail. Jellyfish.
- [Woman] Oh?

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:22.514
(lady laughs)

00:09:22.514 --> 00:09:25.168
(Jimmy laughs)

00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:27.750
- This like timid laugh as he walks away.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.280
Be more proud of your prank dude!

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.280
You can't just nervously walk away

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.930
from your own employees too.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.143
I assume all of these people work for you.

00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:37.258
- Hey what's up everybody?

00:09:37.258 --> 00:09:38.091
How are you all doing?

00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:39.549
(excited chatter)

00:09:39.549 --> 00:09:40.382
What's up dude?

00:09:40.382 --> 00:09:41.383
Snail. Jellyfish.

00:09:41.383 --> 00:09:42.216
- Aw.

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.049
(Jimmy laughs)

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:43.882
- Hey Salone.

00:09:43.882 --> 00:09:44.830
Snail. Jellyfish.
- Wow.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.960
- Yeah, I know dude. I know.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.330
- Ugh, this is so uncomfortable to watch.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.980
Do you think Jimmy came up with this idea

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.160
or do you think a social media intern did?

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.610
This definitely has like dad vibes to it,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.520
so I really feel like
Jimmy came up with it.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.510
So my piece of advice for you Jimmy

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.590
is to hire someone who
knows what Tiktok is

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.670
and have them come up
with your Tiktok ideas.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.430
'Cause this, this ain't it chief!

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.360
So what I had concluded so far

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.990
is that for the good TikTokers,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.840
it seems like they like TikTok.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.990
They enjoy being on it
and they make TikToks

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.100
because it's just like a fun thing to do,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.520
and it's a fun way to express
yourself and create things.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.580
They understand the formats decently well,

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.860
they understand the trends.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.310
Meanwhile, the worst celebrities,

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.760
it seems like they don't
really care about TikTok

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.890
and it's more just a ploy for
them to get more followers.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.770
Push people over to watch their show.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:31.730
Listen to their music.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.550
So it seems like a means to an end

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.940
rather then it's a platform in of itself.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.840
And I thought that was
a pretty rule of thumb

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.300
until someone sent me Bob Saget's Tiktok,

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.150
'cause it seems like he
really likes being on TikTok

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.010
and he really wants to be on TikTok.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.010
But he is going to go
in "the bad" category.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.270
If you don't know who Bob Saget is,

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.270
he was on Full House.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.420
He played Danny Tanner,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.890
and now he's on Fuller House
and he plays Danny Tannest.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.630
Before watching Bob Saget's TikToks,

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.920
I thought that it didn't
really require any talent

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.130
to be good at TikTok.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.090
People say that all the time.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.030
It's like, "Oh you do TikToks?
That requires no talent."

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.240
But if that's true,

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.190
then how is Bob Saget so bad at TikTok?

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.620
Either everyone else has
some sort of TikTok talent,

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.360
or Bob Saget somehow has negative talent?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.050
Let's take a look at
his most recent TikToks

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.693
so you can get an idea of what I mean.

00:11:20.693 --> 00:11:24.416
♪ Yeah I'm gonna take my
horse to the old town road ♪

00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:28.033

00:11:35.837 --> 00:11:36.860
I just want to know, like,

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.690
what did he think he was doing here?

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.510
Is it meant to be silly? Or funny?

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.350
Or like is it suppose to be ironic?

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.260
Does he just want to show off
his cool little horse trinket?

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.850
What am I suppose to feel
when I watch this TikTok?

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:49.990
Because the only thing I feel

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.660
when I watch this is chills.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.520
Or like some kind of deep
seeded unnerving feeling,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.100
like some kind of unnatural
force has possessed

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.410
Bob Saget to make this,

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.570
and to be quite frank, I do not like it.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.628
Let's check out another.

00:12:01.628 --> 00:12:04.580

Are all of Bob Sagets TikToks

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.237
just him showing off silly
items he has around his house?

00:12:13.237 --> 00:12:15.470
Is that what he thinks TikTok is?

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.220
In the next one, he's
going to be wearing a suit

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.350
with a flower on the
lapel and he squirts it

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.380
and water shoots out.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.350

Is Bob okay?

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.470
Bob is really in his feelings in this one.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.040
I'm worried about him a little bit.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.766

Why does he do that?

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.010
Yeah, I'm actually very worried about Bob.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.400
I see the thing is that I
can't tell if he's being ironic

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.250
or if he's really just vibing out here?

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.810
Like does he know that he
looks goofy doing this?

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.680
And if anyone else was
lip syncing like this,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.820
would I think it was normal?

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.670
Is it only weird cause he's old?

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.590
Am I just immediately
skeptical of anyone on TikTok

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.630
that's older than my exact age?

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.463
I don't know.

00:13:14.463 --> 00:13:17.900
- All for the gram. It's a lovely gram.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.733
Oh wait, shit!

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:21.440
- It's just weird 'cause it feels like

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.100
every other celebrity whose bad at TikTok

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.550
just doesn't care about TikTok,

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.430
but Bob Saget really does care.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.502
He really cares, he cares too much.

00:13:28.502 --> 00:13:31.455
♪ Roxanne ♪

00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:33.380
♪ All she wanna do is party all night ♪

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.710
He maybe he's being ironic.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.790
He could be being ironic,

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.960
and he knows it looks
silly 'cause he's old,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.160
and he knows it looks silly

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.060
when old people use social media.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.280
Is he that self aware?

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.560
Maybe Bob is actually good at TikTok,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.330
and I'm a dork for not getting it.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.448
♪ Brr, brr, brr ♪

00:13:47.448 --> 00:13:48.281
Am I the dork?

00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:49.940
Was I the dork the whole time?

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.850
We may never know.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.920
Unless you already know,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.710
in which case I hope I'm not a dork.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.520
I mean, these are actually pretty funny.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.480
I mean, I get enjoyment
out of watching them.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.770
But it's like a weird kind of funny.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.310
It's like it's hard to
decern if it's funny

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.260
for the reason that Bob intended.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.930
And he posted the same TikTok twice.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.300
He posted the horse one again.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.700
Why Bob, why?

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.350
Why was that TikTok so important

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.700
that you had to post it twice?

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.533
I'm starting to think

00:14:13.533 --> 00:14:14.960
that he really just did just want everyone

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.120
to know that he's got that
nice looking horse trinket.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.410
It's a nice trinket Bob.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.560
Is that what you want to hear?

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.620
I like the trinket.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.960
Anyway, I redecorated.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.170
I don't know if you could tell.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.520
I moved things over.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.820
Is it bad? Let me know!

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.320
Golly! I've got to be honest,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.410
I'm not excited to get
copyright claimed 10,000 times

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.000
for using so much copyrighted
music in this video.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.280
But you know what's
going to make that hurt

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.490
a little bit less?

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.760
Today's sponsor Express VPN.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.200
Express VPN is a long time
sponsor of my channel,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.910
which is great because I use
Express VPN almost every day.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.700
Whether it be protecting my online privacy

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.890
when I'm getting work done at like

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.030
a coffee shop or something,

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.160
unblocking content that
is not usually available

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:49.993
in my country.

00:14:49.993 --> 00:14:51.740
For example if I want to
watch a show on Netflix

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.060
that is not available in the U.S,

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.180
it's a simple as turning on Express VPN,

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.560
changing your server location
to where you want to be

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.030
and bada bing, bada boom!

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.790
You've got all the
content that's available

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.740
in that location.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.850
There's lots of VPNs out there,

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.830
so let me tell you why

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.720
Express VPN is my favorite.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.610
Aside from the fact that
they're sponsoring this video.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.570
Express VPN has the fastest speeds.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.560
They actually invest in premium servers

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.010
so that they can offer faster speeds

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:13.980
than any other VPN.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.820
They've got 24/7 customer support.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.330
It's super easy to install and
easy to use once you get it.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.410
You just click the big
button and then it works.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.380
So, pretty easy. Pretty intuitive.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.620
And don't just take my word for it,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.380
'cause it's been rated
the best VPN consistently

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.700
by a bunch of different sources.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.010
Tech Radar, CNET, The Verge,
Compare Tech and many more

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.770
have ranked Express VPN
the best VPN out there!

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.320
So if you want to take
your internet privacy

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.190
into your own hands,

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.540
or just unblock stuff

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.900
that's not available in your country,

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.720
find out how you can get three months

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.410
of Express VPN for free,

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.260

and thank you to you guys
for checking out Express VPN.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.160
I could already tell you this video

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.780
will be copyright claimed immediately

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.830
and I will probably not
make any money from it.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.820
Which is why when I
have sponsors like this

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.840
and you guys check them out.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.860
So thank you for checking out Express VPN,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.810

the sponsored segment.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.370

GREG is what I call my audience.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.300
We are an army.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.930

I'll see you next time with
a really interesting video

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.030
where I put a bucket over my head

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.030
to try to hide my identity from the world,

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.470
but everyone can still tell it's me

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:34.700
because of my big fat butt.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.670
