00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.610
- If you're new to building computers,

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.280
one of the first little pieces of trivia

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.450
you'll probably come
across is that AMD CPUs

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.320
use pins on the bottom, while
Intel ones use little contact

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.340
pads with the pins on the
motherboard socket instead.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.260
But why were these choices made?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.980
Do the engineers at AMD just
think that pins are prettier?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.650
Well, it turns out that
the use of pins versus pads

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.990
is a very deliberate design choice.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.870
You see Intel's approach of
having pins on the motherboard

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.000
instead of the chip, called
a Land Grid Array or LGA,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.110
typically makes it easier
to fit more contacts

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.480
into a smaller space on the CPU.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.660
Modern CPUs need a lot of contacts

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.530
for their high speed
features and to promote

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.020
stable power delivery by
spreading out the current.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.100
The other thought is
that because tiny pins

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.780
are very fragile, you know,
'cause they're super thin,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.670
well, it would be better to
place those on the motherboard

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.460
rather than the CPU because
it's not uncommon to see

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.800
a $400 CPU installed
on a $150 motherboard.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.260
So if one of those things was gonna break,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.190
you'd rather it be the cheaper one right?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.290
Then you can reuse that
CPU on a new motherboard.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.150
Now of course, you can still
mess up an LGA processor

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.240
by touching the gold
contacts on the bottom

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.320
with your oily little fingers.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.750
But overall, they are harder
to damage than pin grid array

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.260
or PGA chips, which are designed

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.580
to help improve your golf game.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.640
No, sorry, just kidding.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.090
PGA chips the ones favored
by AMD are the ones with pins

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.440
on their undersides and
compatible motherboards for those

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.390
have corresponding holes on their sockets.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.760
Now, immediately, you
can probably figure out

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.210
that this makes PGA chips a
little bit easier to damage.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.360
However, there are some
upsides to using this design

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.920
over a Land Grid Array,.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.560
For one, the pins on PGA
chips are a little tougher

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.730
than the motherboard pins that
you'd see in an LGA socket,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.600
meaning that they are easier
to repair in the event

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.450
that they do get bent which I'm sure

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.670
you can sympathize with
if you have ever had

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.520
the misfortune of having to re bend

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.550
even just one damaged pin
on an LGA motherboard.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.330
The superior durability
of PGA pins means that

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.630
they can typically handle
a little more current

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.580
than LGA packages too,
which can be important

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.300
depending on how the
chip itself is designed.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.430
And for another advantage
that you can more

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.550
readily experience firsthand when building

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.610
or upgrading your own
PC, PGA chips tend to be

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.230
a bit easier to install,
since there are no

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.950
super delicate motherboard
pins to worry about.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.790
Though of course, you do
have to make sure that

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.620
you hit every hole in the socket properly.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.230
These advantages have
led AMD to keep using PGA

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.030
for its consumer level
chips, even long after Intel

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.120
abandoned pins on their
desktop chips way back in 2004.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.380
And even though current
3rd Gen rising processors

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.670
actually have more contacts on the bottom

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.100
than their Intel rivals,
AMD still found a way to fit

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.300
all those pins onto one package,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.260
partly because the processors themselves

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.730
are physically larger.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.520
Now as you might have figured
out LGA does allow you

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.070
to cram more contacts per unit of area.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.950
So there actually are
AMD chips that do use it.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.740
There are Threadripper lineup
for high end desktop PCs

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.390
and their epic lineup for
servers are both based on

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.620
land grid array designs
with over 4000 pins.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.640
So if you're lucky enough to
be using one of those monsters,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.110
definitely don't bend

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.640
any of those delicate
motherboard contacts.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.280
As far as what all this means
for you the consumer though,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.440
Well, nothing because you
shouldn't be choosing a CPU

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.510
based on whether it's PGA or LGA,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.090
it doesn't really affect
performance in the way

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.100
that the architectural
design or the clock speeds

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.880
or the core counts that the chips do.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.730
And the reason that Intel and
AMD went their separate ways

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.280
is just because they
valued different aspects

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.120
of these designs since each one

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.070
does have their pros and cons.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.400
It's just important to
be aware of the pitfalls

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.340
whenever you're installing either of them

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.680
so you don't mess up
the bottom of your chip

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.310
unless you want very expensive coaster for

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.770
well your shot glass, wouldn't
be a very big coaster.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.570
But this would be a big
segue to our sponsor.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.950
What's in your online security toolkit?

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.140
Adding a VPN lets you mask
your IP and encrypt traffic

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.150
to and from your devices
and Private Internet Access

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.270
is a pretty great choice
for a reliable VPN

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.860
with over 3300 servers in 30 countries.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.270
There are no bandwidth caps and PIA offers

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.170
configurable encryption
and an internet kill switch

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.490
to keep you in control of your connection.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.430
PIA combined with private
browsing can make websites

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.750
think you're in a different country,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.210
which can be useful for things like

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.350
getting better deals on flights,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.730
at least once this whole
COVID thing has passed.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.150
You can connect up to five
devices at once with clients

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.930
from multiple operating
systems and their MACE feature

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.690
blocks requests to known malware

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.530
and tracking domains
altogether, pretty sweet.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.850

day money back guarantee
