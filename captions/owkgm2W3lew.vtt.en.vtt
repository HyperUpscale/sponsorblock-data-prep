00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.640
- Sup, you beautiful bastards?

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.320
Hope you're having a fantastic Thursday.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.240
Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco Show.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.090
Buckle up, hit that Like button,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.470
and let's just jump into it.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.250
And the main thing we're
gonna be talking about today

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.730
is the coronavirus and
everything it's been touching,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.250
but first specifically, I know that

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.470
there are some people panicking,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.380
but please, please,
please check the sources

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.890
on information that you're
getting around the coronavirus.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.640
I'm not saying true factual
information cannot come

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.560
from influencers or Joe
Blow on Twitter, Facebook,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.250
or whatever, but hold on a beat,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.067
and see if the experts are
actually saying that as well.

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:34.080
For example, one post and
claim that I saw really blow up

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.980
came from Brother Nature,
massive influencer,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.750
also in no way the only
one sharing this stuff.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.650
Right, a lot of these claims
are said to be attributed

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.980
to a member of the
Stanford Hospital Board,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.700
or a doctor in Japan
or something like that,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.957
and among the claims made here,

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:47.207
"everyone should ensure your mouth

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:48.587
"and throat are moist, never dry.

00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:50.857
"Take a few sips of water
every 15 minutes at least.

00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:51.690
"Why?

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.987
"Even if the virus gets into your mouth,

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:54.397
"drinking enough water
or other liquids will

00:00:54.397 --> 00:00:56.537
"wash them down through your
throat into the stomach.

00:00:56.537 --> 00:00:59.417
"Once there, your stomach
acid will kill all the virus.

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.247
"If you don't drink enough
water more regularly,

00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:03.627
"the virus can enter your
windpipe and into the lungs.

00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:04.770
"That's very dangerous."

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.470
And while I think there
are plenty of other reasons

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.490
to make sure that you're drinking water,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.560
this claim is false.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.490
This has been debunked, but once again,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.130
I'm not saying don't drink water.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.993
You should still drink water.

00:01:13.993 --> 00:01:16.070
It's just in general good for your health

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.670
and during any infection.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.300
But the specific claims that
it's making here, not true.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.647
Also, the document claims
"drinking warm water is effective

00:01:22.647 --> 00:01:23.577
"for all viruses.

00:01:23.577 --> 00:01:25.240
"Try not to drink liquids with ice."

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.073
That's not a thing.

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:28.750
Also, in this fun little
viral post of misinformation

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.607
there's the claim "take a deep
breath and hold your breath

00:01:30.607 --> 00:01:31.637
"for more than 10 seconds.

00:01:31.637 --> 00:01:33.427
"If you complete it
successfully without coughing,

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:36.247
"without discomfort, stiffness,
or tightness, et cetera,

00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:38.427
"it proves there is no
fibrosis in the lungs,

00:01:38.427 --> 00:01:40.130
"basically indicates no infection."

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.430
No, that is not true.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.910
As Dr. Loren Rauch, a doctor
at Antelope Valley Hospital

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.130
in Los Angeles who has a
master's degree in epidemiology,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.963
says, "that's not true.

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:49.137
"That can check if you are anxious

00:01:49.137 --> 00:01:50.647
"or have respiratory compromise,

00:01:50.647 --> 00:01:52.220
"but not tell if you have coronavirus."

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.990
Because once again, we've
hit on this a number of times

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.620
since we first started covering this,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.000
you may not have symptoms, and
while some may look at that

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.320
claim and go, oh, what's the harm,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.040
someone's gonna hold their
breath for 10 seconds,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.873
and do what?

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:04.220
Well, one, it's a weird stance

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.820
to defend spreading misinformation,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.200
and also two, you might have someone that

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.993
incorrectly believes that they
do not have the coronavirus.

00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:11.790
All right, so, maybe that
leads to further spread.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.130
And here's the thing, I mean,
I'm not gonna villainize

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.280
all the people sharing this

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.647
and all the celebrities sharing this.

00:02:15.647 --> 00:02:17.740
People are panicking, people want to help,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.240
mistakes are going to get made.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.240
But where I do have issues with
people are when those people

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.400
get called out, or
actually in a very nice way

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.390
get shown the truth, leave up
their incredibly viral posts,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.970
like was the case with Brother Nature.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.930
And ultimately, that's where
we are with this right now.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.530
And so, while often it's not the case,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.520
because the big scary claim
usually gets way further

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.570
than the fact check after,
but I really hope that

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.130
shining a light on this can
gain traction in its own way,

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.080
but maybe even more importantly,
get to the people that are,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.860
even if they have good intentions,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.930
spreading misinformation about
a really troubling issue,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.710
because from the moment that
I started filming this video

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.420
to the moment that I'm
ending filming this video,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.750
that post has continued to go viral.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.540
So, there's that, then the next
thing we have to talk about

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.930
with the coronavirus was
Trump addressing the nation

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.410
last night, because the way he used words

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.340
did not necessarily
reflect an exact reality,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.510
and at times were the exact
opposite of what he said.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.040
So, first up, Trump hit us
with the Europe travel ban.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.040
- To keep new cases from
entering our shores,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.220
we will be suspending
all travel from Europe

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.550
to the United States for the next 30 days.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.430
The new rules will go into
effect Friday at midnight.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.470
These restrictions will be adjusted

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.070
subject to conditions on the ground.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.230
There will be exemptions for Americans

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.980
who have undergone appropriate screenings,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.630
and these prohibitions will not only apply

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.940
to the tremendous amount
of trade and cargo,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.920
but various other things
as we get approval.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.770
These restrictions will also not apply

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.010
to the United Kingdom.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.120
- Right, so, just from that clip,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.661
there are two things that
we have to talk about.

00:03:50.661 --> 00:03:52.630
All right, so, one, Trump
says we're suspending

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.430
all travel from Europe and
then he mentions exemptions

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.630
for Americans who have undergone
appropriate screenings,

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.190
but there is no other
information connected to that.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.070
What are these screenings?

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.903
Where are these screenings?

00:04:01.903 --> 00:04:03.680
Right, and it's really not
until about an hour later

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.470
where the Department of
Homeland Security releases

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.410
a statement that we get a much clearer,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.387
more understandable picture, saying,

00:04:09.387 --> 00:04:11.057
"today President Donald J. Trump signed

00:04:11.057 --> 00:04:13.557
"a Presidential Proclamation
which suspends the entry

00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:15.507
"of most foreign nationals
who have been in certain

00:04:15.507 --> 00:04:18.197
"European countries at any
point during the 14 days

00:04:18.197 --> 00:04:20.650
"prior to their scheduled
arrival to the United States."

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.877
And then adding, "this does
not apply to legal permanent

00:04:22.877 --> 00:04:25.097
"residents, generally
immediate family members

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:27.027
"of U.S. citizens, and other individuals

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:28.690
"who are identified in the proclamation."

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.140
So, the travel ban actually
only affects foreign nationals

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.680
who have been through the listed countries

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.920
14 days prior to trying to
fly to the United States.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.320
There's no mention of
appropriate screenings in this.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.100
There was also no mention
of it Wednesday night

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.550
when the White House listed
all of the exempted groups.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.040
Right, that also didn't
include anything about

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.270
mandatory screening or testing.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.020
But the problem here
is that it still caused

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.900
a lot of confusion and chaos.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.130
For a little while, you had
people that were getting

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.000
on flights or had flights
scheduled to go to Europe going,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.680
okay, wait, wait, am I not
gonna be able to come back?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.030
Also, abroad, according
to reports in Europe

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.840
people just started buying up tickets,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.450
and the prices were skyrocketing,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.430
some reports saying that travelers

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.500
were paying up to $20,000.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.040
And then the second thing
we need to talk about

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.630
from this statement is
the part where Trump says,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.747
quote, "these prohibitions
will not only apply

00:05:07.747 --> 00:05:09.650
"to the tremendous amount
of trade and cargo,"

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.690
well, it turns out that
the president meant to say

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.450
the exact opposite of that.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.307
Trump tweeting later after his address,

00:05:15.307 --> 00:05:17.047
"please remember very
important for all countries

00:05:17.047 --> 00:05:19.367
"and businesses to know
that trade will in no way

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:21.187
"be affected by the 30 day restriction

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.197
"on travel from Europe.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.720
"The restriction stops people, not goods."

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.070
So, it appears that
maybe the answer to why

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.520
you would say the exact
opposite of what you meant

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.177
is that possibly he was supposed to say

00:05:31.177 --> 00:05:33.057
"and these prohibitions will not apply

00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:35.220
"to the tremendous amount
of trade and cargo."

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.790
Also, in the president's
speech, he talked about

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.910
the health insurance industry.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.200
- Earlier this week,
I met with the leaders

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.000
of health insurance industry,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.110
who have agreed to waive all co-payments

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.390
for coronavirus treatments,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.300
extend insurance coverage
to these treatments,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.570
and to prevent surprise medical billing.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.460
- But what we're seeing now from reports

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.260
after this announcement is
no, that's not the case,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.930
with reports saying that
insurers have agreed

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.790
to waiving co-payments for
testing, but not treatment.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.500
Right, so, those were kind
of the main three things

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.520
that needed to be cleared up.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.660
We also saw Trump talk
about economic measures,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.640
once again, calling on
Congress to provide relief

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.010
to workers affected by the virus,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.340
including payroll tax cuts.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.730
But regarding other economic
measures, he also said--

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.150
- To ensure that working
Americans impacted by the virus

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
can stay home without fear
of financial hardship,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.770
I will soon be taking emergency action

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.840
which is unprecedented to
provide financial relief.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.920
This will be targeted
for workers who are ill,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.510
quarantined, or caring for
others, due to coronavirus.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.150
I will be asking Congress
to take legislative action

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.630
to extend this relief.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.380
- And as far as emergency
action, it appears that

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.400
he's now instructed the
Small Business Administration

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.940
to provide loans in affected
states and territories.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.620
Notably around this, Trump
has also asked Congress

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.390
to increase the funding for
that assistance by $50 billion,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.390
also saying that he's instructed

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.160
the Treasury Department
to defer tax payments

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.670
for certain businesses and
people affected by the virus,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.130
adding that that move will
put $200 billion of liquidity

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.130
back into the economy.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.740
And that was essentially it.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.763
Now, as far as the reaction to this,

00:07:02.763 --> 00:07:05.190
I mean, one, the timing
around this was horrible,

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.256
and I'm not placing that
on Trump or something.

00:07:07.256 --> 00:07:09.170
What I mean is that there
was a ton of coronavirus news

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.810
just within a 30 minute block.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.440
Within that 30 minute
window, you had the president

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.850
of the United States, who
once again, just two days ago

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.340
was still kind of going, hey,
guys, the flu is way worse,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.410
announcing a month long
European travel ban,

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.880
Tom Hanks came out saying
that he and Rita Wilson

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.750
had tested positive for coronavirus,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.960
and that the NBA was
suspending their entire season.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.947
We learned today while
filming that the NHL, MLS,

00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:31.190
and the ATP have all
suspended their seasons

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.270
and the NCAA has canceled March Madness,

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.240
and also not a sport,
but a major announcement,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.580
we're seeing the news that now
Disneyland is going to close.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.610
Now, as far as some of the
more specific reactions,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.890
you, one, had people confused
why the United Kingdom

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.510
was not included in this ban.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.340
Right, it's not like they've
dodged the coronavirus.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.260
There have been at least
459 known cases there.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.590
Also, as far as the
European Union's reaction,

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.360
they condemned the travel suspension,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.147
saying the decision
"was taken unilaterally

00:07:54.147 --> 00:07:55.670
"and without consultation."

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.530
People also saying that
there probably was a time

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.900
where travel suspension would have helped,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.340
but the coronavirus is already here.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.700
Right, it appears to be
spreading domestically now.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.480
Also, as far as the U.S. Congress, right,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.920
what's happening with legislation,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.810
right after Trump's address
we saw House Democrats

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.970
unveil a sweeping
coronavirus relief package

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.380
that consisted of a number of measures,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.650
including a national
paid sick leave program,

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.350
free coronavirus testing,
food security assistance,

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.000
and expanded unemployment benefits.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.120
But very notably, not
included in those measures

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.840
was a payroll tax cut, with
both House and Senate Democrats

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.470
arguing that payroll tax cuts,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.090
which would lower the amount
of certain federal taxes

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.750
that are taken out of
each worker's paycheck,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.470
do not help those hit the hardest.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.210
Right, that's because the
tax relief is largely aimed

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.490
at helping those who have more money.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.510
And around this proposal we
saw Nancy Pelosi announce

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.180
that the house is expected
to vote on the legislation

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.570
later today before they
leave for a 10 day recess.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.100
But, according to reports, Pelosi is still

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.970
hashing out the details with
the Trump administration

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.490
and not everyone is onboard.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.320
In fact, we saw House
minority leader Kevin McCarthy

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.780
taking to Twitter this morning
to slam Pelosi and the bill,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.997
saying "the legislation that
Speaker Pelosi introduced

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:52.127
"at 11:00 p.m. last night
written by her staff

00:08:52.127 --> 00:08:53.977
"and her staff alone and plans to vote on

00:08:53.977 --> 00:08:56.627
"just 12 hours later is not
only completely partisan,

00:08:56.627 --> 00:08:57.760
"it is unworkable."

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.460
We also saw Republican
and Senate majority leader

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.060
Mitch McConnell slam the House bill,

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.900
calling it "an ideological wish list,"

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.657
and adding "I hope Senate
Democrats will not block

00:09:04.657 --> 00:09:06.417
"potential requests from
our colleagues today

00:09:06.417 --> 00:09:07.997
"to pass smaller, non-controversial

00:09:07.997 --> 00:09:09.067
"pieces of legislation today."

00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:11.210
And while some Republican
senators have expressed support

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.590
for at least parts of the bill,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.270
it's unclear what the Senate will do here.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.560
Right, do they consider this package?

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.810
Do they propose one of their own?

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.300
But what we have seen
so far at least is that

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.870
this morning McConnell
announced the Senate

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.970
will actually cancel its
plans for the scheduled recess

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.730
next week and will
instead work through it.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.380
Also, to complicate matters even more,

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.110
we're now seeing news about
the first case on Capitol Hill.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.380
Last night, Senator Maria
Cantwell's office confirmed

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.820
that one of her staffers tested positive

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.700
for the coronavirus.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.310
With this, Cantwell announcing
that she was closing

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.110
her D.C. office to have it deep cleaned.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.180
Following that, we also
saw other senators closing

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.410
their D.C. offices as well.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.880
Right, so, this potentially, a big deal.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.840
There's a question of
how widespread is this.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.630
You have thousands of people
who work in the Capitol,

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.990
obviously, that including
senators and Congress members.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.870
So, obviously we're keeping
our eyes glued there.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.120
Also, we should talk about
the economy right now.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.480
The stock market has
been taking a beating.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.210
I mean, hell, just after the Trump speech,

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.000
Dow futures fell by 1,100 points,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.680
and with this, we've seen
the stock market enter

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.410
what they call bear market territory,

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.930
which is just a fancy way of saying that

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.240
they've dropped 20% or
more after recent highs,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.340
and in fact, this morning
those drops were so big

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.630
that investors actually had to
stop trading for 15 minutes,

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.320
which this is the second time this week

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.153
they've had to do that.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.530
All right, and they call
this a circuit breaker.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.940
These breaks are kind of meant
to help investors slow down,

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.530
catch their breath, stop freaking out,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.670
really think about what they're doing.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.840
But it's now actually being reported that

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.317
the Dow is seeing its
worse day since 1987,

00:10:22.317 --> 00:10:24.050
right, and notably, this coming

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.700
after Trump yesterday told people--

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.060
- This is not a financial crisis.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.690
This is just a temporary moment of time

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.200
that we will overcome
together as a nation,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.150
and as a world.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.420
- Also, as far as some
of the companies taking

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.170
the biggest hits right now, I mean,

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.680
you just look at major travel businesses,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.010
like cruise lines and airlines.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.290
Royal Caribbean shares dropped nearly 27%,

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.290
Carnival, 19%, United,
Delta, and American Airlines

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.600
all down more than 12%.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.690
Also, I know that I kind
of mentioned it in passing,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.710
but I wanna bring it back to the NBA.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.010
Right, last night, essentially
what we ended up seeing

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.340
was the NBA postponed a
game between the Utah Jazz

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.560
and the Oklahoma City Thunder,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.250
and I mean, this happened
right before tip-off.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.510
Literally, the arena was packed,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.940
and this was reportedly
because one of the players

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.540
was being tested for the coronavirus.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.900
Those results were about to come in,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.350
and once they did, we
learned that that player was

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.280
Rudy Gobert, and that
he had tested positive.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.840
Now, the quick question around this was,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.100
holy shit, if Rudy has it,
how many other people have it,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.780
not only because you're
talking about someone

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.110
who participates in a game
that's all about touching

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.520
the same thing over and over,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.400
not only because you have tons of people

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.560
in the locker room,
everyone's so close together,

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.230
but because on Monday we
saw this guy joking around,

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.570
seemingly about the coronavirus,
touching all the mics,

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.890
and the recorders, and the table,

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.180
right, essentially, like,
ha, ha, fuck the coronavirus,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.410
and apparently, the
coronavirus was like bet.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.497
And in fact, according to
reports, "Jazz players privately

00:11:34.497 --> 00:11:37.117
"say that Rudy Gobert had been
careless in the locker room,

00:11:37.117 --> 00:11:39.070
"touching other players
and their belongings,"

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.110
which may or may not be
the reason why yesterday

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.560
one of his teammates, Donovan Mitchell,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.650
also tested positive.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.560
Also, in addition to live
events, we're seeing a number

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.630
of movies being postponed,
which I will say,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.730
it's genuinely interesting
that because of this thing

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.820
that is scaring everyone,
right, the coronavirus,

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.140
it's taking away a ton
of the things that we use

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.730
to distract us from how scary
the world can be sometimes.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.750
But to that point, and the
smallest positive thing ever,

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.860
unless the power and the internet go out,

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.760
the Philip DeFranco Show
will still be here for you.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.460
Made that joke about your
grandmothers yesterday,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.290
and way too many of
you were like, yes, no,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.670
this is not a joke, we agree.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.920
But main point, that's where
we are as of recording.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.990
This is still a developing
situation, of course.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.100
As we've been saying
for a while, you know,

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.820
you'll get kind of these updates,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.000
and then a lot will happen at once.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.930
But yeah, I hope you're well.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.730
I also, I hope these videos,
I hope that they're not

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.900
causing you to panic, that
it's making you, you know,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.220
concerned, and you're aware,
and you're an informed person,

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.560
'cause at the end of the day,
I really hope this is helping.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.260
But yeah, those are the stories.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.640
I'd love, of course, love
to hear your thoughts.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.780
This is the end, and hey, of course,

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.740
