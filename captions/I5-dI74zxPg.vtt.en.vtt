00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.170
- I've always thought if we could somehow

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.730
just see the germs around us,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.350
everyone will be a lot more careful

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.060
and we'd get sick way less.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.130
Unfortunately, that's still not possible.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.390
So I did the next best thing

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.340
by running a daylong experiment

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.840
in this third-grade classroom.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.520
I found this powder called Glo Germ.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.010
And just like real germs,
when it's on your hands,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.300
you can't see it.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.100
But unlike real germs,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.890
if you turn a black light
on, it becomes visible.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.810
But it transfers to things you've touched,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.070
so it provides a really good way

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.470
to visualize exactly how germs spread.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.420
So before the kids arrived, as a control,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.580
I went around and noted
any preexisting spots

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.010
in the room that fluoresced
under the black light.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.240
And then it was go time.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.280
The kids, of course, had
no idea what we were doing

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.290
and that the teacher had
been secretly infected

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.280
with the glowing powder.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.590
So she randomly shook
the hands of three kids

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.330
but didn't touch any of the rest.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.996
And so with that, they just
went about their normal day.

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:51.079
(lighthearted music)

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.350
At break, I did choose one random student,

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.030
and he agreed to letting
me put some of the powder

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.870
on his hands too.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.610
And then two hours later at lunchtime,

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.810
I checked the results.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.730
Remember, everything you see here started

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.900
with just the teacher

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.270
and one student having
a little of that powder

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.170
on their hands.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.510
And because my flashlight
can only illuminate one spot

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.343
at a time,

00:01:10.343 --> 00:01:13.020
I used Photoshop to better
visualize our observations

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.580
of where germs were left behind,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.408
including on the other kids.

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:17.717
Uh-oh!
(children exclaiming)

00:01:17.717 --> 00:01:19.137
We're pretty hot over here!

00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:20.310
Oh, right here.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.170
And they were actually pretty diligent

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.670
about washing their hands.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.770
This was the desk of the
kid that was infected.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.630
And what's crazy is that germs could live

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.660
on a hard surface like
this for up to nine days.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.280
And so you can see how important it is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.190
to disinfect the things a
sick person regularly touches.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.440
For example, this was
the phone of the teacher

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.310
in the experiment.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.410
Even if you wash your hands really often,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.330
if you immediately pull out your phone,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.660
a lot of those germs just
go right back on your hands.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.250
Think about when the last time was

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.840
that you cleaned your phone.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.520
My friend Joanna at "The
Wall Street Journal"

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.590
recently demonstrated
you can clean your phone

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.920
with an antibacterial wipe
every day for at least a year

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.380
and it doesn't affect the
oleophobic coating at all.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.420
And this hopefully gives
you a better mental model

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.550
of why it's really
important to wash your hands

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.020
or use hand sanitizer

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.090
after being at places like this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
or this or this or this.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.030
Cleaning commonly touched
surfaces is important

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.620
because even if a virus is spread

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.030
through airborne transmission,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.270
those tiny droplets don't
stay in the air for long.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.070
Then they land on surfaces,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.130
waiting to be touched by our hands.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.570
Which raises an important point.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.240
The ultimate defense
against catching a virus

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.970
is just don't touch your face.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.910
Your eyes, nose, and mouth
are like the single weak spot

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.100
on the Death Star when
it comes to viruses.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.250
That's the only way they
can get in to infect you.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.510
But as you can see here,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.688
not touching your face
is easier said than done.

00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:44.070
(bell dinging)

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.903
And before you think,

00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:46.440
"Yeah, well, that's just kids for you,"

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.030
this was what the
teacher's face looked like

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.960
at the end of the day.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.490
And she said she tried extra hard

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.930
to remember not to touch her face.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.670
I found this result fascinating,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.190
so I put the powder on my
own hands for a few hours.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.460
And I resisted the urge to
touch my face so many times

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.320
that I fully expected I was going

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.950
to have a perfectly clean face
and the moral high ground.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.350
And then this is what I saw.

00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:09.960
(Mark laughs)

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.110
What the heck?

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.750
I genuinely have no idea

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.676
when any of this came on.

00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:19.680
(tape rewinding)

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.540
Until I reviewed the footage.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.030
Oh, well, there you go.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.720
On average, we touch our
face 16 times an hour,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.580
which is why washing
hands is so important.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.250
It's impossible to catch a virus directly

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.300
through your hands.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.160
It's as futile as
shooting the outer surface

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.060
of the Death Star.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.030
The problem is, we use our
hands to help the virus out

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.160
by constantly giving it a ride

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.987
to our figurative Death
Star exhaust ports.

00:03:43.987 --> 00:03:46.623
(guns shooting)

00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:48.060
(explosion booms)

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.893
Because of this,

00:03:48.893 --> 00:03:51.330
I ran another experiment with
some of the kids after lunch.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.340
First, I had them put
some lotion on their hands

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.050
that also glows under a black light.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.730
But then I told them I made a mistake

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.140
and used the wrong lotion.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.930
Could you guys just go
wash your hands real quick?

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.109
And do a good washing, right?

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.200
- 20 seconds.
- Yeah.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.670
Do the right washing, okay?

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.960
I just tricked you guys again,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.140
because what I really wanted
to do is test how good you are

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.250
at washing your hands.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.747
So guess what I'm gonna do now?

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:13.620
- [Children] What?

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.120
- Show me your hands.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.310
But before I show you how
effective they actually were

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.420
at washing their hands,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.760
here's what you should
quickly know about viruses.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.230
They're super tiny,

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.020
but also the most abundant
biological entity on the planet.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.210
In fact, there's over 10 million viruses

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.860
in any single drop of sea water.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.930
And a lot of types of
viruses are beneficial

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.460
to the planet's ecosystem,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.150
and only an insanely tiny
percentage affect humans at all.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.530
And they're really simple.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.830
Viruses are basically a
shell with some DNA inside,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.750
and they just wanna spread and duplicate.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.130
That's their only goal.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.890
But they're so simple that
they need a host to do that.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.470
So they reproduce by
infecting their host cells

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.300
and then trick them to become factories

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.000
that just make more exact
copies of the virus.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.833
When you get sick

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.700
and then cough or sneeze or wipe your nose

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.660
and then touch a surface,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.570
you're putting copies of this
virus out to find other hosts

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.980
and just repeat the process.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.660
And so here's what the
kids' hands look like

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.950
after washing their hands.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.900
Uh-oh, look at the backs.
(children laughing)

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.220
Let me see your fingernails!

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.859
Oh, look at all those germs!

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:11.577
Oh, your thumb!

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:13.855
- Oh, my hand-
- Oh, look at your wrist!

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.090
Look at your wrist!

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.700
We all sort of have a habitual
way of washing our hands.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.533
So once again,

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:21.240
I tried this myself using
the typical quick way I do it

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.073
in my muscle memory.

00:05:22.073 --> 00:05:23.370
Granted, that's better than nothing,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.660
but you could see the difference compared

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.820
to when I was deliberate
and took 20 seconds,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.110
which is why it helps to do things

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.210
like sing the "Happy Birthday" song twice,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.620
or you could do what I do

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.557
and follow Brandon Flowers' example.

00:05:33.557 --> 00:05:36.936
♪ Jealousy, turning saints in ♪

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:40.024
♪ Eager eyes ♪

00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:44.400
♪ 'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside ♪

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.750
- And then for a final experiment,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.030
I wanted to show how dumb handshaking is.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.890
So I infected the first
kid with the powder

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.200
and then had them do a
handshake chain down the line.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.930
The fifth person here still
had significant traces

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.770
on their hand,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.240
so I put him at the first

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.370
and lined four more kids up after him,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.200
and three of their hands glowed.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.540
So we got trace germs
from the original person

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.850
all the way down eight handshakes later.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.200
So if you ever meet me in real life,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.430
please don't be offended

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.010
if in lieu of a handshake
I offer you a fist bump

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.970
and a selfie.
(camera shutter clicks)

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.800
In conclusion, what does this all mean

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.290
with regards to the coronavirus COVID-19?

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.210
You should be concerned
and take this seriously,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.460
but regardless of what you
see in the coming weeks,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.290
there's absolutely no need to panic.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.700
As I'm sure you've heard a bunch by now,

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.050
our goal is to flatten the curve

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.900
so that reported cases stay
just under the capacity

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.980
of the healthcare system,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.050
and social distancing is the best knob

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.820
that we can turn to affect that.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.920
The reason this helps should
hopefully make more sense

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.300
after watching this video,

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.220
especially for those who have
been doubting the science

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.410
and feeling like this
is an extreme reaction.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.960
And my take here is I'm
a practical optimist.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.060
The upside is while this virus is bad,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.320
it could be way worse.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.110
And this gives us a chance
as a global community

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.210
to get some systems and methods in place

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.610
to handle something
potentially even more drastic

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.443
in the future.

00:06:54.443 --> 00:06:57.360
Also, maybe it'll lead to
changing some social norms,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.550
like replacing handshakes with fist bumps

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.170
or when people are really sick

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.870
thinking it's okay to
mingle about and go to work.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.760
Globally, the normal flu kills anywhere

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.950
from a quarter to a half
a million people a year

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.790
due in large part

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.920
to people not practicing
good germ hygiene.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.530
So if this experience makes
people more socially aware

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.750
of the right precautions
to take when they get sick,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.420
that will save countless
lives for years to come

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.670
long after this coronavirus is old news.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.503
And make no mistake,

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:23.730
this is gonna be rough
for some more than others,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.090
but history has shown that us
humans are pretty resilient.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.310
These types of things can
bring out the worst in us,

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.660
but they can also bring out the best,

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.040
most wholesome parts of us,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.920
like these Italians practicing
their social distancing

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.121
with an impromptu balcony concert.

00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:39.300
(people singing in foreign language)

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.940
How we feel about the
situation is largely dependent

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.980
on just which part we choose to focus on.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.870
For me, that means being grateful

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.820
to the heroes in our healthcare system,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.190
or the school lunch ladies
still providing free lunch

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.600
for kids who depend on them,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.280
or the scientists all over the world

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.290
who are working tirelessly
seven days a week

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.600
to create better testing
methods in a vaccine.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.160
This is gonna be a bumpy ride for us,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.140
but the economy will
eventually bounce back,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.400
as it always does,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.980
and we'll be better off
as a global community

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.300
for having gone through this.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.830
Again, take this seriously,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.170
but there's absolutely no need to panic.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.669
We totally got this.

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:14.502
(stream burbling)

00:08:16.038 --> 00:08:18.621
(upbeat music)

00:08:20.311 --> 00:08:22.894
(Mark screams)

00:08:24.862 --> 00:08:29.862
(snowballs thudding)
(kids screaming)
