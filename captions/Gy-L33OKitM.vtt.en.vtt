some of the zooming stuff you can see

but this stuff is really really thick to
 

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.410 align:start position:0%
but this stuff is really really thick to
work<00:16:52.649><c> with</c><00:16:52.860><c> and</c><00:16:53.009><c> it</c><00:16:53.100><c> layers</c><00:16:53.490><c> really</c><00:16:54.089><c> well</c><00:16:54.240><c> and</c>

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
work with and it layers really well and
 

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.300 align:start position:0%
work with and it layers really well and
it's<00:16:54.569><c> really</c><00:16:55.050><c> really</c><00:16:55.170><c> fun</c><00:16:55.410><c> just</c><00:16:56.130><c> sort</c><00:16:56.279><c> of</c>

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:56.310 align:start position:0%
it's really really fun just sort of
 

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.509 align:start position:0%
it's really really fun just sort of
rework<00:16:56.970><c> I</c><00:16:57.180><c> found</c><00:16:57.420><c> myself</c><00:16:57.540><c> being</c><00:16:57.899><c> way</c><00:16:58.490><c> way</c><00:16:59.490><c> more</c>

00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
rework I found myself being way way more
 

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.790 align:start position:0%
rework I found myself being way way more
fussy<00:17:00.269><c> working</c><00:17:00.720><c> with</c><00:17:00.839><c> the</c><00:17:00.930><c> expensive</c><00:17:01.410><c> paints</c>

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
fussy working with the expensive paints
 

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.949 align:start position:0%
fussy working with the expensive paints
I'm<00:17:01.980><c> sure</c><00:17:02.339><c> it's</c><00:17:02.490><c> a</c><00:17:02.579><c> mix</c><00:17:02.790><c> between</c><00:17:02.970><c> it</c><00:17:03.540><c> being</c>

00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's a mix between it being
 

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's a mix between it being
easier<00:17:04.740><c> to</c><00:17:05.039><c> rework</c><00:17:05.549><c> things</c><00:17:05.850><c> but</c><00:17:06.209><c> also</c><00:17:06.360><c> the</c>

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:06.809 align:start position:0%
easier to rework things but also the
 

00:17:06.809 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
easier to rework things but also the
fact<00:17:06.990><c> that</c><00:17:07.079><c> I</c><00:17:07.230><c> spent</c><00:17:07.289><c> a</c><00:17:08.480><c> ridiculous</c><00:17:09.480><c> amount</c><00:17:09.539><c> of</c>

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:09.689 align:start position:0%
fact that I spent a ridiculous amount of
 

00:17:09.689 --> 00:17:12.230 align:start position:0%
fact that I spent a ridiculous amount of
money<00:17:09.750><c> on</c><00:17:09.990><c> paints</c><00:17:10.319><c> and</c><00:17:10.500><c> wanted</c><00:17:11.100><c> to</c><00:17:11.339><c> feel</c><00:17:12.000><c> like</c>

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
money on paints and wanted to feel like
 

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.149 align:start position:0%
money on paints and wanted to feel like
it<00:17:12.510><c> was</c><00:17:12.659><c> worthwhile</c><00:17:12.839><c> so</c><00:17:13.380><c> it's</c><00:17:13.709><c> probably</c><00:17:13.949><c> a</c><00:17:14.010><c> bit</c>

00:17:14.149 --> 00:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
it was worthwhile so it's probably a bit
 

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
it was worthwhile so it's probably a bit
of<00:17:14.220><c> both</c><00:17:14.339><c> but</c><00:17:14.610><c> the</c><00:17:14.699><c> verdict</c><00:17:15.059><c> is</c><00:17:15.270><c> up</c><00:17:15.510><c> to</c><00:17:15.689><c> you</c><00:17:15.839><c> let</c>

00:17:16.159 --> 00:17:16.169 align:start position:0%
of both but the verdict is up to you let
 

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:18.289 align:start position:0%
of both but the verdict is up to you let
me<00:17:16.199><c> know</c><00:17:16.380><c> is</c><00:17:16.890><c> there</c><00:17:17.250><c> a</c><00:17:17.429><c> point</c><00:17:17.789><c> getting</c><00:17:18.179><c> the</c>

00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
me know is there a point getting the
 

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:19.819 align:start position:0%
me know is there a point getting the
super<00:17:18.630><c> expensive</c><00:17:18.959><c> stuff</c><00:17:19.380><c> I</c><00:17:19.530><c> mean</c><00:17:19.650><c> obviously</c>

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:19.829 align:start position:0%
super expensive stuff I mean obviously
 

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.710 align:start position:0%
super expensive stuff I mean obviously
if<00:17:20.370><c> you're</c><00:17:20.640><c> a</c><00:17:20.669><c> better</c><00:17:20.909><c> painter</c><00:17:21.089><c> than</c><00:17:21.299><c> me</c><00:17:21.539><c> there</c>

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
if you're a better painter than me there
 

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.419 align:start position:0%
if you're a better painter than me there
probably<00:17:22.140><c> is</c><00:17:22.289><c> but</c><00:17:22.500><c> what</c><00:17:22.860><c> do</c><00:17:22.980><c> you</c><00:17:23.069><c> think</c><00:17:23.280><c> do</c><00:17:23.370><c> you</c>

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:23.429 align:start position:0%
probably is but what do you think do you
 

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:25.370 align:start position:0%
probably is but what do you think do you
notice<00:17:23.730><c> much</c><00:17:24.059><c> of</c><00:17:24.089><c> a</c><00:17:24.240><c> difference</c><00:17:24.689><c> I</c><00:17:24.900><c> feel</c><00:17:25.230><c> like</c>

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
notice much of a difference I feel like
 

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.710 align:start position:0%
notice much of a difference I feel like
there's<00:17:25.650><c> definitely</c><00:17:25.949><c> a</c><00:17:26.429><c> better</c><00:17:26.730><c> contrast</c><00:17:27.419><c> and</c>

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a better contrast and
 

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a better contrast and
the<00:17:27.839><c> more</c><00:17:28.020><c> expensive</c><00:17:28.470><c> oil</c><00:17:28.950><c> painting</c><00:17:29.490><c> but</c><00:17:29.760><c> at</c>

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:29.850 align:start position:0%
the more expensive oil painting but at
 

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.370 align:start position:0%
the more expensive oil painting but at
