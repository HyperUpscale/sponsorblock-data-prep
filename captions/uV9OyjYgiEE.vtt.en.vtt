00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.190 align:start position:0%
back there that was not in here this is
good<00:13:02.240><c> something</c><00:13:02.480><c> this</c><00:13:02.660><c> is</c><00:13:02.810><c> still</c><00:13:02.960><c> a</c><00:13:02.990><c> good</c>

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
good something this is still a good
 

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
good something this is still a good
quarter<00:13:03.500><c> out</c><00:13:03.620><c> of</c><00:13:03.710><c> this</c><00:13:03.830><c> car</c><00:13:11.080><c> but</c><00:13:12.080><c> you</c><00:13:12.140><c> could</c><00:13:12.260><c> so</c>

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:12.410 align:start position:0%
quarter out of this car but you could so
 

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:21.370 align:start position:0%
quarter out of this car but you could so
probably<00:13:12.650><c> cut</c><00:13:12.890><c> the</c><00:13:13.010><c> rest</c><00:13:19.750><c> like</c><00:13:20.750><c> a</c><00:13:20.840><c> blank</c><00:13:21.170><c> VIN</c>

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:21.380 align:start position:0%
probably cut the rest like a blank VIN
 

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.820 align:start position:0%
probably cut the rest like a blank VIN
pretty<00:13:21.680><c> much</c><00:13:21.830><c> yeah</c><00:13:22.490><c> that's</c><00:13:23.120><c> really</c><00:13:23.300><c> cool</c><00:13:23.830><c> yeah</c>

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:24.830 align:start position:0%
pretty much yeah that's really cool yeah
 

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
pretty much yeah that's really cool yeah
maybe<00:13:25.070><c> I</c><00:13:25.190><c> won't</c><00:13:25.250><c> touch</c><00:13:25.460><c> the</c><00:13:25.640><c> glass</c><00:13:28.510><c> I</c><00:13:29.510><c> figure</c><00:13:30.260><c> I</c>

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:30.290 align:start position:0%
maybe I won't touch the glass I figure I
 

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.900 align:start position:0%
maybe I won't touch the glass I figure I
think<00:13:30.530><c> I'll</c><00:13:30.590><c> be</c><00:13:30.710><c> better</c><00:13:30.830><c> as</c><00:13:30.980><c> is</c><00:13:31.190><c> for</c><00:13:31.370><c> now</c><00:13:31.400><c> so</c>

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:31.910 align:start position:0%
think I'll be better as is for now so
 

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.070 align:start position:0%
think I'll be better as is for now so
how<00:13:32.180><c> about</c><00:13:32.240><c> the</c><00:13:32.420><c> rest</c><00:13:32.570><c> of</c><00:13:32.660><c> selfie</c><00:13:32.900><c> already</c>

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
how about the rest of selfie already
 

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.210 align:start position:0%
how about the rest of selfie already
took<00:13:33.200><c> out</c><00:13:33.350><c> like</c><00:13:33.530><c> what</c><00:13:33.710><c> does</c><00:13:33.770><c> this</c><00:13:33.950><c> look</c><00:13:34.160><c> like</c>

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:34.220 align:start position:0%
took out like what does this look like
 

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.070 align:start position:0%
took out like what does this look like
it's<00:13:35.000><c> just</c><00:13:35.150><c> they're</c><00:13:35.300><c> all</c><00:13:35.420><c> random</c><00:13:35.690><c> harnesses</c>

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's just they're all random harnesses
 

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:42.100 align:start position:0%
it's just they're all random harnesses
that<00:13:36.170><c> they</c><00:13:36.260><c> actually</c><00:13:36.380><c> tagged</c><00:13:40.870><c> okay</c><00:13:41.870><c> the</c><00:13:42.050><c> only</c>

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:42.110 align:start position:0%
that they actually tagged okay the only
 

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.900 align:start position:0%
that they actually tagged okay the only
different<00:13:42.530><c> one</c><00:13:42.830><c> for</c><00:13:43.100><c> the</c><00:13:43.190><c> auto-fire</c><00:13:43.610><c> would</c><00:13:43.760><c> be</c>

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
different one for the auto-fire would be
 

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.910 align:start position:0%
different one for the auto-fire would be
the<00:13:44.150><c> the</c><00:13:44.480><c> roof</c><00:13:44.720><c> the</c><00:13:45.020><c> headliner</c><00:13:45.350><c> one</c><00:13:45.620><c> which</c><00:13:45.770><c> is</c>

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
the the roof the headliner one which is
 

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
the the roof the headliner one which is
different<00:13:46.310><c> that's</c><00:13:46.610><c> right</c><00:13:46.820><c> because</c><00:13:47.180><c> the</c>

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.330 align:start position:0%
different that's right because the
 

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.010 align:start position:0%
different that's right because the
autopilot

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:48.020 align:start position:0%

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.980 align:start position:0%

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:50.990 align:start position:0%
ap one had the camera slash module all

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:54.770 align:start position:0%
so that has changed out but the rest of
 

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.050 align:start position:0%
so that has changed out but the rest of
it<00:13:54.860><c> was</c><00:13:54.920><c> added</c><00:13:55.280><c> in</c><00:13:55.370><c> everywhere</c><00:13:55.820><c> else</c>

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:56.060 align:start position:0%
it was added in everywhere else
 

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.150 align:start position:0%
it was added in everywhere else

what's the feasibility of cutting off
 

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.930 align:start position:0%
what's the feasibility of cutting off
those<00:13:58.640><c> frame</c><00:13:58.970><c> rails</c><00:13:59.240><c> and</c><00:13:59.560><c> converting</c><00:14:00.560><c> a</c><00:14:00.940><c> p85</c>

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:01.940 align:start position:0%
those frame rails and converting a p85
 

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.700 align:start position:0%
those frame rails and converting a p85
to<00:14:02.300><c> a</c><00:14:02.330><c> p85d</c><00:14:04.270><c> like</c><00:14:05.270><c> it's</c><00:14:05.480><c> well</c><00:14:06.290><c> actually</c><00:14:06.470><c> well</c>

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:06.710 align:start position:0%
to a p85d like it's well actually well
 

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.590 align:start position:0%
to a p85d like it's well actually well

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
no because if this is part this is part
 

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.270 align:start position:0%
no because if this is part this is part

of the strut tower it's all part of the

ripped it right and the size of these
rails<00:14:19.070><c> is</c><00:14:19.280><c> completely</c><00:14:19.670><c> different</c><00:14:20.030><c> for</c><00:14:20.300><c> the</c><00:14:20.510><c> D</c>

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:20.690 align:start position:0%
rails is completely different for the D
 

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.410 align:start position:0%
rails is completely different for the D
so<00:14:21.290><c> it's</c><00:14:21.440><c> actually</c><00:14:21.620><c> from</c><00:14:22.100><c> this</c><00:14:22.310><c> part</c><00:14:22.640><c> forward</c>

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:23.420 align:start position:0%
so it's actually from this part forward
 

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.820 align:start position:0%
so it's actually from this part forward
it's<00:14:23.630><c> just</c><00:14:23.720><c> completely</c><00:14:24.170><c> different</c><00:14:24.260><c> so</c><00:14:24.770><c> you</c>

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:24.830 align:start position:0%
it's just completely different so you
 

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.060 align:start position:0%
it's just completely different so you
have

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.070 align:start position:0%
have
 

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.460 align:start position:0%

this<00:14:32.420><c> orange</c><00:14:32.780><c> is</c><00:14:33.020><c> actually</c><00:14:33.710><c> glue</c><00:14:34.100><c> and</c><00:14:34.700><c> it's</c><00:14:35.240><c> a</c>

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:35.330 align:start position:0%
this orange is actually glue and it's a
 

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.230 align:start position:0%
this orange is actually glue and it's a

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
structural glue it's in there it's not
 

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.980 align:start position:0%
structural glue it's in there it's not
so<00:14:38.240><c> you</c><00:14:38.300><c> better</c><00:14:38.570><c> body</c><00:14:39.020><c> shop</c><00:14:40.480><c> a</c><00:14:41.480><c> lot</c><00:14:41.750><c> of</c><00:14:41.870><c> them</c>

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:41.990 align:start position:0%
so you better body shop a lot of them
 

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.830 align:start position:0%
so you better body shop a lot of them
it's<00:14:42.620><c> not</c><00:14:42.800><c> it's</c><00:14:43.340><c> you</c><00:14:43.580><c> just</c><00:14:44.030><c> do</c><00:14:44.480><c> more</c><00:14:44.660><c> damage</c>

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's not it's you just do more damage
 

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.420 align:start position:0%
it's not it's you just do more damage

just go and convert it there's a lot of

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
for sure so the rack it bolts in by
 

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.680 align:start position:0%

it<00:18:43.649><c> bolts</c><00:18:44.070><c> this</c><00:18:44.580><c> way</c><00:18:44.879><c> and</c><00:18:45.330><c> it's</c><00:18:46.139><c> it</c><00:18:46.320><c> the</c><00:18:46.470><c> motor</c>

00:18:46.639 --> 00:18:46.649 align:start position:0%
it bolts this way and it's it the motor
 

00:18:46.649 --> 00:18:48.289 align:start position:0%
it bolts this way and it's it the motor
sits<00:18:46.860><c> vertical</c><00:18:47.309><c> that's</c><00:18:47.730><c> why</c><00:18:47.850><c> I</c><00:18:47.879><c> say</c><00:18:48.059><c> there's</c><00:18:48.240><c> a</c>

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
sits vertical that's why I say there's a
 

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:49.940 align:start position:0%
sits vertical that's why I say there's a
lot<00:18:48.509><c> to</c><00:18:48.779><c> do</c><00:18:48.899><c> a</c><00:18:48.929><c> conversion</c><00:18:49.230><c> for</c><00:18:49.559><c> dual</c><00:18:49.710><c> motor</c>

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:49.950 align:start position:0%
lot to do a conversion for dual motor
 

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.070 align:start position:0%
lot to do a conversion for dual motor
yeah<00:18:50.250><c> now</c><00:18:50.490><c> this</c><00:18:50.700><c> there's</c><00:18:50.970><c> there's</c><00:18:51.360><c> a</c><00:18:51.419><c> lot</c><00:18:51.690><c> yeah</c>
