00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.190
- This video was made
possible by Tab for a Cause.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.430
Raise money for charity
just by opening new tabs

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.020
which we're going to do anyway.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.470
The coronavirus is an all-out pandemic.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.650
We're close to reaching levels

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.490
of almost 100,000 new infections per day.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.630
But obviously somebody
has to be at fault, right?

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.290
Some have blamed President Trump,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.990
President Trump has blamed China,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.300
and Fox News can't decide
who it wants to blame.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.720
But at least we can all agree
that this is Florida's fault.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.840
But of course there are
a lot of people suffering

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.310
in significant ways and many dying

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.210
as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.010
And that leaves many wondering

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.150
who is liable for this whole mess?

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.800
And more importantly, can I sue them?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.870
So by popular demand, and I
got a lot of requests for this,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.110
today we're gonna cover
whether you can sue China,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.690
whether you can sue President Trump,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.082
or Fox News over handling
the coronavirus crisis.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.749
(fanfare music)

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.320
Hey, Legal Eagles, it's
time to think like a lawyer

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.480
because the coronavirus is in the U.S.,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.170
and as Americans when there's
a problem we file suit.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.370
- Touch me and I'll sue.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.780
- But in the court of law
the question still remains

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.250
who, if anyone, can be
legally held accountable

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.790
for the damages suffered
from the coronavirus?

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.550
I mean this is America.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.300
There has to be someone that we can sue

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.950
over this coronavirus, right?

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.410
Well, let's take a look at
a few of the big players

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.410
when it comes to who may be responsible

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.580
for the size and magnitude

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.230
of the current coronavirus pandemic.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.960
So first, can we sue China?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.400
Blame certainly just
doesn't lie with one person

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.800
or even one country for that matter,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.880
but for those affected by COVID-19

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.370
one might first look to where
it all originated: China.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.150
It was first discovered in Wuhan, China,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.960
where the virus first appeared
as this mysterious pneumonia

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.180
that began with just a few
infections of a few patients.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.610
And it was China, where
despite having an alleged

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.510
first-class infectious disease
reporting system in place,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.880
they completely failed to
contain the spread of the virus

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.680
because of local health officials' fear

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.090
of providing bad news to the
central health authorities

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.270
for the Republic of China.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.640
It could certainly be argued
that but for China's failure

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.750
to take the proper proactive measures

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.680
this virus could have
been largely contained,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.720
and many, if not most,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.040
would not have had to suffer
the impact of the virus.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.230
So that is the argument,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.230
and whether you believe
that argument or not,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.380
I will leave that up to you.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.780
But it does raise the question

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.350
if there is any veracity to it

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.130
could someone who become
sick with the coronavirus

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.010
have a legitimate legal
claim against China?

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.130
We don't often hear about individuals

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.110
suing another foreign government,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.070
and there's a very good reason for that.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.540
There's one hurdle that's
almost impossible to overcome

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.440
under the current
circumstances, and that hurdle

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.700
is known as the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.230
which was passed in 1976 to
protect foreign sovereigns

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.530
from the burdens and costs of litigation.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.720
You can't really sue foreign governments.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.120
Now despite the alleged mishandling

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.290
of the coronavirus outbreak
and the lack of transparency

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.740
and presumably the ensuing damages

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.920
that resulted from the
government and China's actions,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.890
any attempt to sue them
would be completely in vain.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.390
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.677
states that, "A foreign
state shall be immune

00:03:03.677 --> 00:03:04.927
"from the jurisdiction of the courts

00:03:04.927 --> 00:03:07.470
"of the United States and of the States."

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.920
The force and scope of the
immunity is pretty daunting.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.620
For instance, when the family of a child

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.940
who was killed by an allegedly
malfunctioning hunting rifle

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.550
sued the manufacturer of the rifle

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.950
which was actually owned
by the Chinese government,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.650
the defendant didn't even bother

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.340
to file a response to the complaint.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.460
Instead the company

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.270
just sent the complaint
back to the plaintiff

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.970
and the court ultimately
held that the company

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.620
was immune under the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.280
Now on its face this
law might seem unfair,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.340
but there's a legitimate purpose

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.280
behind the broad sovereign immunity right.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.130
It's essentially an act of reciprocity

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.810
in ensuring that the United
States will not be sued

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.350
in other countries as well.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.590
Now there are exceptions to this immunity,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.620
but they're incredibly limited.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.710
There are some carve-outs
regarding terrorist acts

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.990
like what we've seen with
Iran and Libya, for example.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.140
And there is an exception
if a foreign state

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.540
actually waives its immunity

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.180
or if the lawsuit is based
upon a commercial activity.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.230
But here the only potentially
relevant exception

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.647
would be if damages were,
"caused by the tortious act

00:04:01.647 --> 00:04:03.717
"or omission of that foreign state

00:04:03.717 --> 00:04:06.657
"or of any official or
employee of that foreign state

00:04:06.657 --> 00:04:09.550
"while acting within the scope
of his office or employment."

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.040
Now this sounds like it might
be a plausible exception,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.130
except for the fact that this
section specifically bars

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.687
any claim "based upon the
exercise or performance

00:04:17.687 --> 00:04:19.317
"or the failure to exercise

00:04:19.317 --> 00:04:21.247
"or perform a discretionary function

00:04:21.247 --> 00:04:24.020
"regardless of whether
the discretion be abused."

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.310
Now based on the information
we currently have,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.170
it's not clear how any lawsuits stemming

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.100
from the coronavirus pandemic
could find a plausible way

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.920
to get into one of these exceptions

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.500
and overcome the immunity that
almost all governments have.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.940
But you don't know until
you try, I suppose,

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.410
and that's exactly what an attorney

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.130
by the name of Matthew
Moore out of Boca Raton

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.670
is attempting to do right now.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.410
Just recently a class action lawsuit

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.230
has been filed against the
People's Republic of China,

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.260
among other parties,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.160
for damages that have resulted
from the global pandemic.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.337
The central allegation
of the complaint is that,

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.667
"The PRC and the other
defendants knew that COVID-19

00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:01.327
"was dangerous and capable
of causing a pandemic,

00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:04.547
"yet slowly acted, proverbially
put their heads in the sand

00:05:04.547 --> 00:05:07.920
"and/or covered it up for their
own economic self-interest."

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.910
The lawsuit then goes on
to allege injury, damage,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.917
and loss related to the
outbreak of the COVID-19 virus,

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:16.557
"including discernible
physical manifestations

00:05:16.557 --> 00:05:18.937
"and injuries of trauma
from the negligent conduct,

00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:21.037
"including, but not
limited to physical pains,

00:05:21.037 --> 00:05:23.310
"headaches, anxiety, and insomnia."

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.020
The plaintiffs are
arguing that the lawsuit

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.280
falls under these exceptions

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.730
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.340
as a commercial activity,

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.880
and because of the tortious harm or death

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.290
that resulted from the Chinese
government's negligence

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.360
in handling the coronavirus outbreak.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.500
Now ironically, none of
the initial plaintiffs

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.210
have actually contracted
the coronavirus itself,

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.440
which leads to all kinds
of standing issues,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.470
but on top of that, what
they're effectively alleging

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.320
is that the Chinese government
didn't handle the situation

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.920
as well as it should have,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.040
but you can't sue foreign
governments just because you wish

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.360
they would have done something different.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.100
That's exactly what sovereigns do.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.130
They govern and you don't
get to sue governments

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.460
over mishandling of things
in their core function.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.690
This lawsuit is definitely
going to get dismissed,

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.240
and barring any new information

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.620
almost all of the
lawsuits in a similar vein

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.130
are going to be dismissed as well.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.030
But that's the Chinese government.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.900
It's all the way across the Pacific.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.740
What about a government closer to home?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.510
What about suing President Trump himself?

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.170
- I don't take responsibility at all.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.140
- What about suing him

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.100
for how he has handled
the coronavirus response?

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.450
- When you say me, I didn't do it.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.140
- The argument is that President Trump

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.470
has told people to go back
to work while being sick,

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.950
stated that the virus
would go away miraculously,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.350
and even gave Americans
false hope by claiming that

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.570
we were on the brink of
having a vaccine available

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.150
and that tests would be plentiful

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.370
and available to anyone that wanted them.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.690
- Anybody right now and yesterday,

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.810
anybody that needs a test
gets a test, they're there.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.510
They have the tests, and
the tests are beautiful.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.160
Anybody that needs a test gets a test.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.770
- And there are reports that the president

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.500
resisted widespread testing

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.833
to keep the number of
infections artificially low.

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:05.920
- I like the numbers being where they are.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.753
- And if that's not enough,

00:07:06.753 --> 00:07:09.010
let's take a very specific recent example

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.780
where President Trump took to Twitter

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.400
to promote two antimaleria drugs:

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.280
chloroquine and its
derivative hydroxychloroquine

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.600
as miracle cures for COVID-19.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.840
And while there may be
some potential benefit

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.980
from these drugs, the manner
in which the president

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.270
has presented these drugs,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.490
which is based on incredibly
preliminary information

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.760
led some to believe that
you could take the drugs

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.180
as a prophylactic
against the virus itself.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.450
Such was the case for an Arizona couple

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.890
that heard the president's report

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.060
and realized they had
some fish tank cleaner

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.700
that contained the so-called miracle drug.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.930
And because of their
reliance on President Trump,

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.470
they both decided to ingest
the fish tank cleaner,

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.480
and as a result the wife was hospitalized

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.080
while the husband actually died.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.480
Now I'm sure most people

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.410
wouldn't think to ingest
fish tank cleaner,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.210
let alone take it
prophylactically against a virus

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.140
that is not actually fatal for
most people that contract it,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.600
but the point is there was
an allegedly misleading

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.890
if not outright false statement
made by the president.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.190
- It's not like a brand new
drug that's been just created

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.050
that may have an unbelievable

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.960
monumental effect like kill you.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.450
- People relied on those statements,

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.300
and as a direct result of that reliance

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.520
individuals were injured
and one actually died.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.260
Slam dunk case, right?

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.540
Well, not so fast, because
just as foreign governments

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.310
have immunity from suit, so
too do domestic governments,

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.190
and in particular the president.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.510
In the Supreme Court case
of Nixon versus Fitzgerald,

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.590
the contractor sued the
president, among others,

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.990
for the loss of his position
with the U.S. Air Force.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.470
But the Supreme Court held
in a five to four decision

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.790
that the President is
entitled to absolute immunity

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.490
from liability for civil damages
based on his official acts.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.410
The Court made clear distinctions
on presidential liability

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.730
noting that presidents could
still be charged criminally

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.020
for official acts.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.250
In addition, unofficial acts of presidents

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.550
were also fair play.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.690
This distinction between
official and unofficial acts

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.610
was solidified in the famous lawsuit

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.190
by Paula Jones against
then President Clinton

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.960
for alleged sexual harassment committed

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.860
while he was governor of Arkansas.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.140
The Supreme Court held that
there was no justifiable reason

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.490
including separation of powers

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.810
that would prohibit federal courts

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.920
from hearing Jones' sexual harassment suit

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.990
since it did not have to
do with any official acts

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.530
made by President Clinton while in office.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.390
Justice Stevens who wrote
the majority opinion

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.257
reasoned that, "The
litigation of questions

00:09:21.257 --> 00:09:23.687
"that relate entirely to
the unofficial conduct

00:09:23.687 --> 00:09:26.077
"of the individual who
happens to be the President

00:09:26.077 --> 00:09:28.817
"poses no perceptible
risk of misallocation

00:09:28.817 --> 00:09:31.850
"of either judicial power
or executive power."

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.190
But where a suit involves the
official acts of the president

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.280
in his capacity as president,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.360
then the president would
be immune from suit.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.470
Now the argument for giving
the president immunity

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.210
for official acts is twofold.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.830
First, the Supreme Court
noted in Clinton versus Jones

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.927
the president needs immunity
for official acts so he can,

00:09:48.927 --> 00:09:52.430
"perform designated functions
effectively without fear."

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.110
The second justification for
this immunity lies in the fact

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.120
that there are sufficient
checks and balances

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.800
on the president that most others

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.040
including other executive
officials don't have to face.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.460
In addition to increased
scrutiny the president faces

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.860
from the media and a
desire for reelection,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.090
Congress can oversee
the president's actions

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.770
in a variety of ways including
the power of impeachment.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.470
At least in theory.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.950
Many have argued that the president

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.640
has misled the American people

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.380
and has mismanaged the
coronavirus pandemic.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.040
- You know, a lot of people
think that goes away in April

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.460
with the heat as the heat comes in.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.540
Typically that will go away in April.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.860
We're in great shape though.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.840
- And that, as a result of those actions,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.750
it should be at least be
considered negligence,

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.400
but it would be impossible to argue

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.400
that any of those actions or lack thereof

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.390
fell outside of his official conduct

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.040
as President of the United States.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.480
And it's for this reason
whether you like him or not

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.600
you cannot sue him for the
actions that he has taken

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.280
as President of the United States.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.120
Okay, so we're zero for
two, no governments,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.880
but there has to be
someone that we can sue

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.180
and actually get to the
merits of the case, right?

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.300
Well, maybe.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.290
Some have argued that Fox News

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.440
as well as other cable news channels

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.420
have promoted incorrect
information, misleading comments,

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.420
and other conspiracy theories
that have been detrimental

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.120
to actually fighting the
coronavirus pandemic.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.440
- As the Surgeon General
said on Justice last week,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.840
you don't need a mask unless you're sick.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.360
- But the issue of suing Fox News

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.920
or other cable news channels

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.870
isn't exactly coming out of left field.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.880
And, as a result, some have argued

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.610
that Fox News ought to face some liability

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.480
for the misinformation that
they allegedly have circulated.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.570
And Fox News itself
appears to be concerned

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.990
they may be subject to a
potential lawsuit form viewers

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.490
for their misleading
reporting of the coronavirus.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.470
In fact, just recently
Fox Business Network

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.090
parted ways with Trish Regan

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.490
just a few days after she
made the bold declaration

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.907
that the coronavirus was,

00:11:41.907 --> 00:11:44.340
"another attempt to
impeach the president."

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.000
- And like with the Mueller investigation,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.480
like with Ukrainegate, they
don't care who they hurt.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.830
- So if indeed their reporting
is misleading or false

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.030
and with a bunch of viewers
that showed up a little late

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.930
to the game having relied on
the message pushed by Fox News,

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.060
could these viewers have a
cause of action against Fox News

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.330
for injuries that they suffered

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.250
as a result of the coronavirus?

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.920
Well the initial answer is
they could probably file suit,

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.180
but that doesn't necessarily mean

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.730
that the suit would be successful.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.210
Probably quite the opposite.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.930
In theory, an individual
could bring a civil lawsuit

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.930
against Fox News for committing an act

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.620
or omission that gave
rise to an injury or harm

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.770
for which the courts
could impose liability

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.810
commonly known as a tort.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.240
The argument would most likely be

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.930
that they breached a
duty to the plaintiffs

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.510
in presenting them with false
or misleading information

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.720
and that as a result of which

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.950
the plaintiffs suffered
significant damages.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.050
Now we don't have time
to get into the nuance

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.150
of every aspect of tort
law and civil litigation,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.150
but most likely a claim of this nature

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.370
could be made by a plaintiff

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.650
on the grounds of something
like public nuisance

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.770
or maybe some form of
negligent misrepresentation.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.310
In a suit for public nuisance
the plaintiff can recover

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.100
for activities that hurt a neighborhood

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.040
or society as a whole.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.560
But to be liable for public
nuisance it must be proven

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.110
that the defendant interfered
with public property

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.780
or a right that is common to the public.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.930
But usually that's reserved

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.810
for creating a public health hazard.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.900
Another argument could be
made for suing Fox News

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.850
under a negligent
misrepresentation theory,

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.960
although that's typically
seen in contract actions

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.390
or quasi-contract actions

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.530
where the main premise
of the misrepresentation

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.830
has to do with a person's failure

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.040
to exercise a reasonable duty of care

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.400
which in turn causes another person

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.120
to be injured in some manner.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.080
Basically someone says
something that's false.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.120
They either knew it was false at the time,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.700
or they should have known
it was false at the time,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.310
and as a result another person
detrimentally relies on that

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.050
and incurs damages.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.860
But Fox News doesn't have
a contractual relationship

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.170
with its viewers and doesn't
really have an obligation

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.090
to do anything on behalf of its viewers

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.930
including telling them the truth.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.410
Some states have consumer
protection statutes

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.243
that might apply.

00:13:45.243 --> 00:13:47.330
For example, a consumer watchdog group

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.060
called WASHLITE in Washington State

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.080
filed a suit against Fox News
claiming its news coverage

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.490
violated consumer protection statutes.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.300
That particular suit also alleged

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.260
that Fox committed the tort of outrage

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.910
which isn't really a thing.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.160
Sometimes that's a synonym

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.840
for intentional infliction
of emotional distress,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.070
but that definitely doesn't apply here.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.320
So the first suit out of
the gate suing Fox News

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.870
is pretty much nonsense

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.380
and is absolutely going to get
dismissed very very quickly.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.540
In general throwing nonsensical
claims into a complaint

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.550
is not a good look, and
that doesn't bode well

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.550
for the success of your lawsuit.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.730
Now despite having these plausible

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.070
and some not so plausible legal grounds

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.660
to file suit against Fox News,
it's important to remember

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.670
that the goal is not
just to file a lawsuit

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.370
but actually to win and get damages.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.860
Now beyond the initial hurdles

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.000
such as proving that a plaintiff

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.820
could establish justifiable reliance

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.380
on information received
from a partisan news source,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.540
Fox News will have many
many defenses in its arsenal

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.110
to probably get all of
these potential lawsuits

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.750
dismissed pretty quickly.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.410
The first and strongest
defense for Fox News

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.210
is probably free speech
under the First Amendment.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.970
You might not agree
with Fox News' message,

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.590
but they have a First
Amendment right to say it,

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:00.820
and they should.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.970
Now the framework for
the free speech defense

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.210
starts with the seminal
case from the 1960s

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.250
called New York Times versus Sullivan

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.920
which held that the First Amendment's

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.600
protections of free speech

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.230
are not limited to just
truthful statements,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.807
because, "An erroneous
statement is inevitable

00:15:15.807 --> 00:15:18.447
"in free debate, and must be protected

00:15:18.447 --> 00:15:19.617
"if the freedoms of expression

00:15:19.617 --> 00:15:23.220
"are to have the breathing space
that they need to survive."

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.410
Over the years this holding

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.450
has led to a fairly bulletproof defense

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.840
for all sorts of tort actions

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.190
including those for product
liability, defamation,

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.770
including those involving media outlets.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.070
Now I have covered the holding

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.260
in New York Times versus Sullivan

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.530
on this channel many times in the past.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.190
I'll probably do it again
because it is always relevant,

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.030
but the idea is that we
shouldn't punish misleading

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.520
or false speech in most cases.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.130
We should simply fight it
with more accurate speech.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.780
And we generally don't want
the government making decisions

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.410
as to what speech is true
and what speech is false.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.927
- They are the fake, fake disgusting news.

00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:02.150
(crowd cheering)

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.880
- That's a dangerous road to go down.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.760
Another defense would be the
lack of proximate causation.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.450
Fox News would probably argue

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.900
that any plaintiff would
be unable to show that

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.167
whatever the misleading
statements from Fox News

00:16:14.167 --> 00:16:19.120
was the actual proximate act
that led to their contracting

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.230
of the coronavirus or
the economic downturn.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.760
There are lots of different factors

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.880
going on at any given time,

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.640
and it's unlikely that
Fox News contributed

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.660
in the last instance to
the damages suffered.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.070
And another defense is that
Fox News would simply argue

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.147
that they don't have a duty
to any of their viewers.

00:16:37.147 --> 00:16:38.910
There's not a special relationship

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.610
that gives rise to any special duty.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:45.970
If you are walking by a pool
and you see someone drowning,

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.350
generally speaking unless you
pushed them into the pool,

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.440
you don't have a duty to pull them out.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.900
Now the no-duty rule,

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.260
which has its origin in cases
involving property owners,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.420
generally holds that a
defendant owes no duty of care

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.110
to warn, protect, or insure against risks

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.200
that are common, frequent, or expected.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.033
And since Fox News

00:17:03.033 --> 00:17:05.110
doesn't have any particular
special relationship

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.120
with any of its viewers,
it doesn't owe a duty

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.640
and therefore can't be held liable

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.430
for any kind of negligent acts.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.730
This is generally what
we call a SLAPP suit,

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.560
or in other words a strategic lawsuit

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.000
against public participation.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.670
And if you didn't like Bob
Murray suing John Oliver,

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.240
which I did a video about,

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.090
then you really shouldn't be in favor

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.760
of people trying to
stifle news organizations

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.650
or politicians for
exercising their free speech.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.530
We might not like what they have to say,

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.470
but they should be allowed to say it.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.850
So yeah, this is America.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.030
If you can dream up a successful lawsuit,

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.070
then odds are there will be an attorney

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.290
that will file it for you.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.197
- Can you imagine a world without lawyers?

00:17:41.197 --> 00:17:43.780
(bright music)

00:17:45.418 --> 00:17:46.251
Oh!

00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:48.220
- But just because you can file a lawsuit

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.410
doesn't mean that you should.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.370
And it's an unfortunate reality

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.640
that so many people are suffering
under the circumstances,

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.270
but the answer is not always a lawsuit.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.470
It's hard for me to say
that as an attorney,

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.410
but it is not always the case
that the best thing to do

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:06.170
is to sue people or to even
be able to sue certain people.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.360
There are good reasons

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.360
why we have some of these
legal defenses in place.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.440
Now I know you think you'd
make the world a better place

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.430
by suing these people into oblivion,

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.490
but really you'd be
doing more harm than good

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.000
because we don't want
lawsuits that stifle speech.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.400
But if you do really wanna
do some good for this world,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.360
try Tab for a Cause, which lets
you raise money for charity

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.670
just by opening up new tabs
and browsing the internet

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.540
which you were probably
going to do anyway.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.610
Tab for a Cause is a
Google Chrome extension

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.370
that allows you to pick
the charity of your choice

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.310
and then every time you open up a new tab

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.930
instead of a blank page it displays

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.570
a beautiful new customizable
tab with a couple of tiny ads.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.010
The money that you generate is
then donated to your charity.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.030
You see in real time how much
money is being generated.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.570
And it's gamified so that
every time you open up a tab

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.640
you create a heart which
you can then donate

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.340
to the charity of your choice.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.590
Tab for a Cause is partnered

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.320
with several COVID-19
specific charities too,

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.350
so you can fight the effects
of coronavirus directly.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.820
Directly from your couch.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.230
The gorgeous new tab that you
open up is really helpful too.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.830
You can customize it with graphics.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.330
I like to see pictures of the outdoors

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.000
to remember what the outdoors look like.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.520
Anyone remember the outdoors?

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.940
It was really great, wasn't it?

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.570
And then it lets you customize
things like bookmarks,

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.700
create to-do lists, and
even write yourself notes,

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.930
which I find really helpful
to have in a new tab

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.420
every time I open it up.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.320
And once you've opened up a tab or two,

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.990
you can choose the actual charity

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.810
that you want the money to go to.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.750
There's absolutely no charge to you,

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.120
and it makes a positive
difference in this world.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.240
All you have to do is click
the link in the description

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.520
and install the Google Chrome extension.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.990
Tab for a Cause users like you

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.730
have raised hundreds of
thousands of dollars for charity.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.550
It has got to be the easiest possible way

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.580
to donate to charity.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.650
You could even just sit there

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.380
and open up a bunch of tabs for fun.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.040
So just click on the
link in the description

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.260
to download the extension

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.060
and do some good by doing
what you were gonna do anyway.
