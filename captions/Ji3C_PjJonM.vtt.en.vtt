00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Ask most people what they know about trams in London, and they'll say...

00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:07.265
Erm... I know there's trams in Croydon.

00:00:07.265 --> 00:00:08.605
But I think that's it..?

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:13.005
But did you know London used to have the biggest tram network in Europe?

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:17.580
So what happened to it? And why is Croydon the only part of London that has trams today?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.080
♫ ♫ ♫

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.060
In oldy woldy times, when pretty much every mode of transport involved a horse

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.540
the best way of getting lots of people to the same place was an omnibus.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.660
It was an uncomfortable and bumpy ride.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.980
But a clever solution would be brought to London by an eccentric Victorian billionaire from America

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.180
whose name was George Francis Train.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.240
Ha! Really?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.700
Mr. Train's cleverly simple idea was to have omnibuses run on rails running along the street.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.020
Mr. Train called them "trams".

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.300
Suddenly horses could carry much heavier loads, and go much faster and smoother

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.320
without giving everyone an orgasm.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.420
This also made them affordable. Fares were set at the reasonable price of half a penny.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.540
But other road users hated Train's trams.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.580
The rails weren't recessed into the road, they stuck out good and proper

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.100
tripping up other vehicles and causing their wheels to break off.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.660
But Train continued to build his tramways all over London without ever asking permission first.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.860
Until he was stopped in his tracks in 1861 when he was arrested for "Breaking and injuring the Uxbridge Road".

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.360
From now on, any entrepreneur wanting to build tramways in...

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.060
From now on, any entrepreneur wanting to build tramways in London would have to bury their tracks

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.060
nicely into the road out of harm's way, and pay for the maintenance of the entire road surface.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.540
This meant they now had to solve a rather sticky problem.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.780
The average horse produced between 15 and 35 pounds of manure per day.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.220
It was famously predicted that if London's horse traffic continued to increase

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.295
it would be nine foot deep in horse manure by 1950.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.195
The solution eventually came at the end of the nineteenth century

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.680
with a source that was safe, efficient, cheap, clean and reliable.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.340
Electricity.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.520
Electricity could be harvested either from cables above the road, or a conduit below.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.220
Now that horses were no longer required and the trams were totally turd free

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.600
the network was able to grow and grow.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.060
The London County Council built new connections linking working class suburbs with industrial areas

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.260
to help get people to work, making it the first truly public transport system in London.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.920
They spread particularly far in south and east London

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.800
to areas which, by no coincidence at all, continue to be poorly served by the Tube.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.400
Everywhere in London was getting electric trams.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.220
Well, almost everywhere.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.380
If you look at this map of the network, you'll see a vast area close to central London

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.120
where tram tracks fear to tread.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.580
These were the posh parts of town: Kensington and Westminster.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.040
Well, that's understandable I suppose. Westminster had historic streets.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.380
And those overhead cables were so ugly.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.860
That was the reason they weren't wanted here, right?

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.900
Wrong. Many trams used the conduit system with no visible cables.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.520
So, if it wasn't cables, why were they so trams-phobic?

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.920
Trams, for want of a better expression, were for poor people.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.640
Local campaigners complained that trams catered for "an undesirable class of person"

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.760
and successfully kept the entire central London area unbetrammed.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.940
- Thank you, Sir.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.620
Because of this, two vast networks north and south of the river remained unconnected.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.100
Not because of the Thames, but because of toffs.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.380
And it would stay like this until 1906, when a big and very impressive tramfrastructure project was built here.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.840
Kingsway in Holborn was built by bulldozing straight down the middle of the slums.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.320
The Victorians used to do this sort of thing all the time

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.120
but Kingsway was special because it came with its very own tram tunnel

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.560
something never done in London before, or since.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.240
This small but truly unique piece of track linking north to south meant that by 1914

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.760
London had the biggest tram network in Europe.
- Yaay!

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.180
But not for long.
- Awww.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.680
After WWI, money was tight, and tram rails were expensive to maintain.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.920
So the tram operators began turning to a newer, cheaper piece of technology - the trolleybus.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.220
Trolleybuses were like trams but on pneumatic tyres.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.200
They didn't need rails, which meant they were quieter and more flexible

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.460
and they could overtake things, like this dick.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.880
It was the beginning of the end for the tram. And the middle of the beginning for the trolleybus.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.080
But alas, alack, London's trolleybuses were not long for this world.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.000
One person whose fault this was, was Minister for Transport Ernest Marples

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.020
the man responsible for provisional driving licences, MOTs, traffic wardens,

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.500
single yellow lines, double yellow lines, Doctor Beeching, and several affairs with prostitutes.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.040
Marples wanted people driving more, partly because the car was a symbol for individual freedom

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.160
but partly because Marples's family ran a tarmac company.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.920
Marples got councils to change their streets to make more room for cars

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.620
which meant cables had to be torn down.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.860
London's vast network of trams and trolleybuses would need to be replaced by motor buses.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.280
Until then, the idea of getting motor buses to take on such a big job was unthinkable.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.540
Motor buses were small and heavy and noisy and inefficient.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.700
But that would all change...
* ding ding *
in 1959.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.520
The new Routemaster bus which was super efficient and ran on diesel

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.440
could carry almost as many people as a trolleybus, but had two massive advantages.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.300
1. Drivers wouldn't have to worry about the trolley poles coming loose

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.300
and 2. They could overtake each other. In fact, they could go literally anywhere.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.980
With diesel fuel now cheaper than ever, it was a no-brainer.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.880
From 1959, Routemasters began replacing tram and trolleybus routes all over London.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.160
The network's capacity was reduced slightly.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.480
but since passenger numbers were dwindling anyway, nobody cared.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.140
Well, lots of people cared and they were really upset about it. But nobody who mattered cared.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.740
It was out with the... *electric motor noise*,
and in with the... *diesel engine noise*

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.180
So is there anything left of London's tram and trolleybus network that you can still see today?

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.280
Well...

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.680
There are a few surviving tram sheds, some still with tram tracks in.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.760
Eh.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.000
There's a couple of trolley poles still there that are now used as lamp posts.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.980
Ooh!

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.200
There's a bus route in west London that still uses the number 607, the same as the original trolley...

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.660
Boring!

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.740
And this building in Walthamstow has the word "tramway" on it.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.480
So the answer is no, not really. Nothing impressive.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.180
With one massive exception.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.560
This...  this...

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.500
This is what's left of the Kingsway Tunnel.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.480
You can still see very very very clearly where the tram tunnel entrance used to be.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.835
Sometimes they open it up for tours, sometimes they use it as an art gallery

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.340
but at the moment it's being used to help Crossrail construction.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.840
Down at the other end, the entrance has been turned into the door of a night club

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.120
and the middle half has been turned into the Strand Underpass.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.860
And so, the trams and trolleybuses had gone, and London forgot about them.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.460
And so did the whole country.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.120
Cities up and down the UK were ripping up their tram tracks and pulling down their trolley cables.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.700
The only place in the country that kept its tram was Blackpool pleasure beach.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.340
Trams, for decades, evoked images of nostalgia and the olden days.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.135
- I used to take the tram for a farthing.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.820
Even the word "tram" was funny.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.480
- ...straight in front of a tram.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.140
But then, something changed.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.620
Traffic congestion was worsening,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.960
Demand for public transport was increasing,

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.500
Pollution became a thing,

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.100
and trams, suddenly, all of a sudden, had gradually started to suddenly become appealing again.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.980
Croydon in south London which had a growing town centre and no Tube

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.040
was the perfect place for a 21st century experiment.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.060
For the first time in 48 years, trams were coming back.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.820
These trams would be a fair bit different from the 20th century ones.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.600
They were single, not double decker

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.120
And they were multiple articulated units.
Which basically means they're bendy.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.260
As well as running on the streets, the new trams would make use of bits of disused or underused railways

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.600
combining the on-street convenience of buses, with the separate-ness and speed of trains.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.940
The Croydon Tramlink, opened in 2000, was an instant hit, attracting 15m passengers in its first year

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.040
and that number's kept going up ever since.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.960
At around the same time, very similar tram schemes opened in Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.920
Birmingham, and Edinburgh. And don't get me started on the resurgence of trams in the rest of Europe.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.420
So trams are very much back in business for the 21th century.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.340
But what about London? Are there plans for any more new tram routes in London?

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.680
The Cross River Tramway, planned to open in 2016

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.280
was meant to run from Camden Town to Peckham/Brixton.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.120
The route used Kingsway, but bafflingly had no intention of using the old Kingsway tunnel,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.980
instead running on the street above.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.900
The scheme had plenty of support, but not enough plenty of money. So it never happened.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.320
Then there was the West London Tram

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.120
planned to run along one of London's busiest bus corridors from Shepherds Bush to Uxbridge.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.180
But two burly men in suits holding a big sign were stood in the way

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.660
so this never happened either.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.040
To be fair, a road like this isn't suitable for modern trams, and most of London isn't.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.100
To dig up a street this narrow to build the tracks would be prohibiti-tively impractica-cactical.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.000
Some campaigners tried to save the West London Tram by suggesting a compromise

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.940
where they just put the electricity cables up and make it a West London Trolleybus instead.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.640
Personally, I think that would have been a brilliant idea.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.240
A trolleybus is the best of both worlds: Cheaper and easier to build than a tram

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.660
but it still replaces noisy polluting buses.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.240
In fact, come to think of it, why don't we do that everywhere?

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.340
London's more than 8,000 buses are a huge source of dangerous pollutey air that kills

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.580
that kills 9,500 people per year.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.360
TfL have tried to make them greener, but the best they've been able to come up with

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.640
is a hybrid bus that uses its diesel engine a mere most of the time.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.800
The bad news is, the technology for a 100% pollution-free bus that doesn't need cables at all

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.720
is not coming any time soon. So I say, let's get a groove on and hang those cables back up!

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.300
A modern trolleybus would only need cables on two thirds of its route

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.340
and those cable wouldn't need to be so spider webby anymore.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.660
There's no avoiding it, those overhead wires would still be fugly

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.260
But it's not just technology that's moved on, it's our priorities too.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.420
And if 21st century Londoners finally get to breathe clean air

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.000
then those hideous wires might end up looking quite beautiful.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.520
- Hey do you want to hear my new podcast?
- No.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.060
Great! It's called "Mates Bants" with an 8 and a Z.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:47.780
(very muffled, crackly, barely audible male chatting and laughing)

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.900
- The audio quality's really terrible.
- Oh! I knew I was no good at recording podcasts.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.440
I don't have the knowledge how to do it. I'm rubbish.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.760
There there. I have a solution for you.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.460
Why don't you sign up for a monthly subscription to Skillshare?

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.980
Skillshare is an online learning tool where you can take a course about how to make podcasts sound good

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.460
or if podcasts aren't the thing you want to get better at

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.100
there are courses about music production, or video editing

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.200
That's my favourite!

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.280
or animation. What's more, if you click the link in the description below

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.760
the first 500 of you will get Skillshare for free for the first two months.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.220
Oh my gosh, thank you! How can I ever repay you?

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.380
Just under ten dollars per month should do it.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.040
That's how much it costs for an annual subscription to Skillshare.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.020
- When I say "skillsh", you say "air". Skillsh!
- Air!

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.740
- Skillsh! - Air! - Skillsh! - Air!

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.800
...
- Air!

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
- Ah, I didn't say "Skillsh"
- Ohh!!
