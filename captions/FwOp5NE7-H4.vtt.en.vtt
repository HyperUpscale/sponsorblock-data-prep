00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.510
- This is the Galaxy Z Flip,

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.510
whereas I'll be calling it Z Flip.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.310
Has anybody else done that yet?

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.410
- Z Flip.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.980
- Everyone has already done that, I dunno.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.380
I didn't watch anyone else's videos

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.440
'cause I didn't wanna color my impressions

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.400
of the second foldable phone

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.730
from Samsung or is it the third?

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.430
Do we count the one that they recalled?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.620
So I'm getting it late.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.740
The reason is that
Samsung didn't send me one

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.630
and I had to wait for retail availability,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.940
but that doesn't change

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.590
how excited I am about this device.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.160
As you guys might remember,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.970
I was a huge fan of the Galaxy Fold

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.580
and the flip is just,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.510
well kind of an extension
of the same concept.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.870
So the idea is that you've
got a device that takes up

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.700
very little space when it's folded up

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.570
and then expands into
something much larger.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.070
Oh wait, that's interesting.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.230
I just unfolded it

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.530
and it actually has a
bit of a curve to it.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.630
You know, I thought that
that might be just a problem

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.830
with my Galaxy Fold.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.020
So it doesn't fold all the way,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.530
but it might just be to do
with Samsung's hinge design.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.670
Can you tell on camera

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.170
that it's an open a little bit too far,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.680
man, that bugs me way more
than it probably should.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.780
All right, let's go, indeed
ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.723
Really?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.970
Apple finally did away with this

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.030
and now Samsung forces
you to insert a SIM card

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.780
in order to set up the
phone the first time.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.050
No micro SD expansion,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.690
so we've just got a SIM
slot here, all right.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.680
Let's restart this thing, I mean,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.670
I guess this is better than
what Samsung used to do

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.020
where when you put in your SIM card,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.190
it would reset the phone
that you had already set up.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.070
That was really cute.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.070
Well, let's take a look at this thing.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.130
So it's got a USB type C port,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.830
it's got wireless charging
on the right-hand side.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.260
They've got a side mounted
fingerprint sensor,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.070
as well as a volume rocker up here.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.350
No IP rating of any sort on this thing,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.250
which kind of makes sense,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.550
it'd be really difficult to
keep water out of the hinge.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.550
Dual 12 megapixel rear camera,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.110
so this is not gonna
be a photography beast.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.943
And this is cool.

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:52.620
So this is a small external display

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.460
that'll tell you, you know,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.760
a notification that's coming in

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.070
or whatever the case may be,

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.170
and that'll allow you
to flip open the phone

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.260
and carry on where you left off.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.410
While we wait for this to boot up though,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.733
let's try the actual flipness of it.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.933
I was one of those people

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.810
who's been using a cell phone long enough

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.290
to have actually had a flip phone.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.330
And like half the reason you
get one is for the satisfaction

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.440
of being like, yeah,
what's up, you know, hey,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.167
I'm just gonna talk on my
phone and then closing it up.

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:21.720
And I will say the sound isn't great.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.060
And the extra width actually makes it

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.310
a little bit uncomfortable to do that.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.143
You know what?

00:02:27.143 --> 00:02:28.040
I'll give it a B.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.600
I wish it had a more
satisfying sound on the close.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.840
It slows down a little bit

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.920
as it approaches fully opening up.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.510
And part of that might be because

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.600
they've designed it to be
configurable in multiple spots.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.860
So that snap only happens
from about here on, right?

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.490
Other than that, you can kind
of stick it wherever you want.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.236
It's a really cool design.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.450
I think it's still booting up.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.660
So there have already been some
durability tests determining

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.130
just how glass likes
Samsung's flexible glasses,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.650
but can you see that?

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.160
What the hell?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.170
And I wasn't even poking
at it super hard though.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.610
What made me notice it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.800
was that I had just like
touched it or something

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800
and I put it down

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.830
and the reflection of
the studio lights here

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.570
made it really obvious that there's like

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.300
some give to it.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.710
And then it's kind of like
memory foam bouncing back up.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.403
Oh, it's super soft.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.870
All right, are we ready
to set this thing up?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.130
Nice, this is a very tall display.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.420
And I don't know if part
of why it seems so tall

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.960
is because the hinges are on the side.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.440
It does, doesn't it?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.130
This is a really expensive phone that

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.340
other than the foldness and the hinge

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.810
doesn't feel that futuristic

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.860
like when you're actually using it.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.889
Like, do you guys think
I'm being unfair so far?

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.910
Okay, 'cause I'm not trying to be unfair.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.250
Okay though, you know what?

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.750
Holding these two phones in my hand

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.990
while I was copying an
authentication key over,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.040
the narrowness actually feels pretty good.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.120
Like it's more similar to the
old candy bar style phones

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.150
than I initially realized.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.070
Maybe I missed that a
little bit, you know?

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.210
Oh, okay, I was gonna say
reaching across as quite easy,

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.090
but then with how tall it is

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.960
like with how top heavy it is,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.900
it's easy for it to fall out of your hand.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.570
Don't worry I got a dbrand skin on there

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.610
for those incidental
scars and scrapes, right?

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.770
Wow, that is really high up to reach to

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.750
go to like the URL bar.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.600
I can't think of anything I've ever used

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.910
where I got to reach up,

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.500
I have to shift my hands
so much to reach that.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.990
One of the initial criticisms
I heard of this thing is that

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.080
scrolling over the hinge is
really weird and uncomfortable.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.890
My take so far is

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.510
I wouldn't normally be
scrolling up that high,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.680
at least with the size
of hands that I have.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.920
I wouldn't really go any higher than here.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.420
And I don't know if you can see this,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.960
but the hinge is right around here.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.810
This does feel weird in other ways though,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.370
like mobile internet

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.730
was designed with 16 by
nine devices in mind.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.000
And then we started getting
these slightly wider ones.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.260
Just one result, just one
Wikipedia article takes up.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.093
What is that?

00:05:04.093 --> 00:05:06.260
That is over a third of my display.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.930
One of the pictures on Samsung site

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.750
is like multitasking on this thing.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.120
I can't even see this entire post

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.800
because it contains some text

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.010
and it's a retweet that
also had some texts on it.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.730
Like that is not a usable experience.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.120
I go on the product page for this,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.140
and it's like, yeah,
massive 6.7 inch display,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.960
it's like, you realize
you're the same company

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.210
that just launched the S20
Ultra at the same event.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.070
And it's a bit of a
hack in the first place

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.070
because measuring your screen diagonally

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.920
instead of by the total screen
area is sort of cheating.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.210
I mean, this is still really cool,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.015
and I'm never gonna get over this.

00:05:42.015 --> 00:05:44.244
Yeah, yeah, cool, right?.

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:45.500
- [David] It's scrolling, wow.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.040
- Well, yeah, but it's
scrolling around the bend.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.680
Look, I'm scrolling this way

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.486
and they image is going that way.

00:05:51.486 --> 00:05:53.413
What, what.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.663
How much is this thing costs?

00:05:55.663 --> 00:05:58.205
Like $1500, something like that.

00:05:58.205 --> 00:05:59.038
You know what?

00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:00.240
Let's look up how much this thing costs.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.390
I actually don't know.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.370
No, okay, no, that's just like
a horrible Canadian pricing.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.110
Okay, so it's 1,380.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.350
So it's a little less than 1,500 US.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.490
If nothing else, I'll
say this about the price.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.250
Samsung's got a lot of guts
asking more than iPhone pricing

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.750
for something that doesn't even have

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.410
top tier Android phone specs.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.310
So it Snapdragon 855 rather than 865,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.440
is got 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.920
just a 3300 mAh power battery.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.690
So you're gonna be using this for one day

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.580
and one day only between charges.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.300
And then probably the
biggest problem for me

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.590
is the dual 12 megapixel cameras.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.130
Like on the one hand you're telling me

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.120
this is a phone for people
who are really image obsessed,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.460
because why else would
it be important to you

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.310
to whip out a foldable phone be like, yes,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.550
this is a hinge on the back of my phone,

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.740
but I don't care about
having a good camera.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.740
I mean, I shouldn't say it's not good

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.740
without actually trying it.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.010
So let's go, we've got our
double tap to open the camera

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.860
and hey Andy, how you doing?

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.950
Yeah, what does this, what is this?

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.510
We got two guys doing the work

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.010
and then two of them to watch.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.010
Wow, it's got this white balance way off,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.420
you notice that?

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.070
Stay within three feet of the subject.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.730
These live bulkhead
effects are still so bad.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.040
I gave it the best possible
case scenario, a box.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.790
And it still manages to have
this part of the table in focus

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.510
for no apparent reason

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.800
and manages to blur this line.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.170
Like, what is this?

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.060
This is one of their pitches.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.750
Whether it's for video calling

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.820
or for just like taking selfies,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.780
is being able to put your
phone in front of you like this

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.130
and just be like, oh, look at that.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.460
That would be pretty
cool for video calling.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.460
The one problem I had is

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.230
they've also got shots on their site

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.320
of people holding it like
this for video calling

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.000
that is not ergonomic at all.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.450
This is way better,
that was smooth though.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.000
That animation going from folded mode

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.670
to full screen mode, me like it.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.010
Maybe we can get rid of some
of that beauty smoothing.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.570
I don't need no more beauty.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.930
I am beautiful enough
without the beauty smoothing.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:09.800
Thank you, sir.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.250
Let's give it another
chance without any filters.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.850
Look at how much fun am having,

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.100
that's what you're supposed
to do for a selfie, right?

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.973
Yeah, that's not great.

00:08:17.973 --> 00:08:20.410
It's not terrible, it's like fine.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.930
Look how much keyboard this is.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.500
And it's so narrow,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.590
my thumbs are almost too close sometimes

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.360
it's the opposite problem
you have compared to

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.880
when you're like typing
on a tablet or something.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.210
Wow, and when you're watching
video vertically, I mean,

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.530
I guess if you're super
into the YouTube comments,

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.680
I confess I am the kind of person

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.160
who will occasionally watch
a video in vertical mode,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.290
just because it's a
little bit more ergonomic.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.840
That is so little video on the screen.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.860
I mean, this is good though.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.890
Lots and lots of YouTube comments to read.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.230
So this is 22 by nine which actually is

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.410
very, very close to the
standard cinema aspect ratio.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.340
So that's why it was really hard for me

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.160
to tell if it was cutting
anything off the top,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.750
it might be, but it
would be ever so slightly

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.390
as long as you can get
over the whole punch,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.890
which I think for something this wide

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.293
is much easier to forgive,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.988
that's pretty great.

00:09:08.988 --> 00:09:11.571
(upbeat music)

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.470
No way,

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.000
Okay, that is disappointing.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.580
The wide aspect ratio screen
was giving me an argument

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.550
for watching movies on
the go on this thing

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.970
until I realized that's
not an amplified ear piece.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.460
So it's mono audio just from
the bottom firing speaker

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.110
on this side here.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.560
There's no question that
the cool factor is there.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.430
My problem is that with the fold,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.050
I had this compelling argument to make,

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.780
if you needed a bigger screen,

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.830
but only had a pocket to keep it in,

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:40.920
this was your solution.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.890
So it was kind of like
the laptop that way,

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.340
it took a computer and
put it in your backpack.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.410
And then the fold took a tablet

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.670
and it put it in your pocket.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:53.670
Well, this takes a phone
and puts it in your pocket,

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.220
but just instead of being long and thin,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.060
its shorter and thicker.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.360
This is a last gen device, is a Note9,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.280
so it's actually very
similar in terms of spec,

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.130
but I am getting more screen for my dollar

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.010
and actually more features
things like the S pen.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.950
Let me know in the comments,

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.920
if you want it to get
the full LTT experience.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.330
But for now I think the
flip is just one of those

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.720
milestones along the way,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.373
two devices that make a lot
more sense than it does.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.930
Thanks for watching this
episode of Short Circuit,

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.350
make sure you are subscribed.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.810
This is a different
channel in Linus Tech Tips.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.570
So you have to subscribe to it separately.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.433
It's hard, I know, but you can do it.

00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:32.540
It's like just move that mouse hand,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.230
get that sheet dust out of the way, click,

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.063
you got this.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.980
By the way, I just wanna shout out dbrand

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.180
they didn't sponsor the video or anything

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.420
but they did get us the device

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.320
with our LTT orange
and black colors on it.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.040
I don't know if they knew
we were not gonna do a video

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.550
on the LTT channel with it, but
it was good effort you guys,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.970
thank you, you can check
them out at dbrand.com below
