00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.350 align:start position:0%
i was driving that thing so if you've

ever seen like a really big warehouse
 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.110 align:start position:0%

and<00:05:23.440><c> you</c><00:05:23.520><c> see</c><00:05:23.680><c> that</c><00:05:24.080><c> crane</c><00:05:24.479><c> that's</c><00:05:24.720><c> on</c><00:05:24.800><c> the</c><00:05:24.880><c> big</c>

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
and you see that crane that's on the big
 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.629 align:start position:0%
and you see that crane that's on the big

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
rail at the top that can move pretty
 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.310 align:start position:0%
rail at the top that can move pretty

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
much wherever it wants basically like
 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
much wherever it wants basically like
that<00:05:28.560><c> it's</c><00:05:28.720><c> pretty</c><00:05:28.800><c> much</c><00:05:28.960><c> what</c><00:05:29.120><c> it</c><00:05:29.199><c> was</c><00:05:29.520><c> but</c>

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
that it's pretty much what it was but
 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.189 align:start position:0%
that it's pretty much what it was but
much<00:05:29.919><c> faster</c><00:05:30.400><c> when</c><00:05:30.560><c> you</c><00:05:30.720><c> when</c><00:05:30.880><c> you're</c><00:05:31.039><c> really</c>

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
much faster when you when you're really
 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
much faster when you when you're really
going<00:05:31.440><c> when</c><00:05:31.600><c> you</c><00:05:31.840><c> reef</c><00:05:32.160><c> on</c><00:05:32.320><c> the</c><00:05:32.400><c> joystick</c><00:05:32.960><c> yeah</c>

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
going when you reef on the joystick yeah
 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.430 align:start position:0%
going when you reef on the joystick yeah
so<00:05:33.759><c> it's</c><00:05:34.000><c> it's</c><00:05:34.160><c> just</c><00:05:34.320><c> an</c><00:05:34.479><c> actuation</c><00:05:35.039><c> point</c><00:05:35.280><c> but</c>

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's just an actuation point but
 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.110 align:start position:0%
so it's it's just an actuation point but
you<00:05:35.600><c> can</c><00:05:35.759><c> program</c><00:05:36.160><c> on</c><00:05:36.320><c> the</c><00:05:36.400><c> computer</c><00:05:36.800><c> how</c><00:05:36.960><c> you</c>

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
you can program on the computer how you
 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.710 align:start position:0%
you can program on the computer how you

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
want it to move so you can check out
 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.390 align:start position:0%
want it to move so you can check out

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%

you test a batch of switches and the

it and then this was really cool now
 

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
it and then this was really cool now
cherry<00:10:05.120><c> was</c><00:10:05.279><c> telling</c><00:10:05.600><c> us</c><00:10:05.760><c> this</c><00:10:06.000><c> production</c>

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
cherry was telling us this production
 

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.350 align:start position:0%
cherry was telling us this production
line<00:10:06.880><c> is</c><00:10:07.040><c> actually</c><00:10:07.920><c> 20</c><00:10:08.240><c> years</c><00:10:08.560><c> old</c><00:10:09.040><c> yeah</c><00:10:09.200><c> so</c>

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
line is actually 20 years old yeah so
 

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.590 align:start position:0%
line is actually 20 years old yeah so
this<00:10:09.600><c> is</c><00:10:10.160><c> far</c><00:10:10.560><c> from</c><00:10:10.800><c> the</c><00:10:10.880><c> state</c><00:10:11.120><c> of</c><00:10:11.200><c> the</c><00:10:11.360><c> art</c>

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
this is far from the state of the art
 

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
this is far from the state of the art
that<00:10:11.760><c> we</c><00:10:11.839><c> might</c><00:10:12.080><c> find</c><00:10:12.480><c> in</c><00:10:12.720><c> some</c><00:10:12.880><c> of</c><00:10:12.959><c> the</c><00:10:13.120><c> top</c>

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
that we might find in some of the top
 

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
that we might find in some of the top

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
more top secret lines because this arm
 

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.910 align:start position:0%
more top secret lines because this arm
like<00:10:28.160><c> picks</c><00:10:28.480><c> up</c><00:10:28.640><c> the</c><00:10:28.720><c> keyboards</c><00:10:29.360><c> top</c><00:10:29.680><c> half</c>

like picks up the keyboards top half
 

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.670 align:start position:0%
like picks up the keyboards top half
bottom<00:10:30.240><c> half</c><00:10:30.480><c> puts</c><00:10:30.720><c> them</c><00:10:30.959><c> on</c><00:10:31.040><c> the</c><00:10:31.200><c> line</c><00:10:31.600><c> and</c>

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
bottom half puts them on the line and
 

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.230 align:start position:0%
bottom half puts them on the line and

these ones it didn't it didn't require
 

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.949 align:start position:0%
these ones it didn't it didn't require
individual<00:10:39.760><c> keycap</c><00:10:40.160><c> placement</c><00:10:40.480><c> so</c><00:10:40.640><c> we</c><00:10:40.800><c> didn't</c>

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
individual keycap placement so we didn't
 

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
individual keycap placement so we didn't
get<00:10:41.120><c> to</c><00:10:41.200><c> see</c><00:10:41.440><c> some</c><00:10:41.600><c> of</c><00:10:41.760><c> the</c><00:10:41.920><c> stations</c><00:10:42.320><c> running</c>

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
get to see some of the stations running
 

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.389 align:start position:0%
get to see some of the stations running
yeah<00:10:42.880><c> he</c><00:10:42.959><c> said</c><00:10:43.120><c> it</c><00:10:43.279><c> was</c><00:10:43.360><c> a</c><00:10:43.440><c> lot</c><00:10:43.680><c> cooler</c><00:10:44.079><c> earlier</c>

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
yeah he said it was a lot cooler earlier
 

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.750 align:start position:0%
yeah he said it was a lot cooler earlier
in<00:10:44.560><c> the</c><00:10:44.640><c> day</c><00:10:44.800><c> but</c><00:10:44.959><c> these</c><00:10:45.200><c> this</c><00:10:45.360><c> is</c><00:10:45.440><c> like</c><00:10:45.600><c> a</c>

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the day but these this is like a
 

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
in the day but these this is like a
special<00:10:46.160><c> order</c><00:10:46.399><c> for</c><00:10:46.480><c> the</c><00:10:46.640><c> german</c><00:10:46.959><c> government</c>

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
special order for the german government
 

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.670 align:start position:0%
special order for the german government
so<00:10:47.839><c> all</c><00:10:47.920><c> the</c><00:10:48.160><c> key</c><00:10:48.399><c> caps</c><00:10:49.040><c> were</c><00:10:49.360><c> sort</c><00:10:49.519><c> of</c>

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
so all the key caps were sort of
 

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.150 align:start position:0%
so all the key caps were sort of
pre-assembled<00:10:50.959><c> um</c><00:10:51.279><c> so</c><00:10:51.440><c> it</c><00:10:51.519><c> skipped</c><00:10:51.839><c> a</c><00:10:51.920><c> lot</c><00:10:52.079><c> of</c>

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
pre-assembled um so it skipped a lot of
 

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.150 align:start position:0%
pre-assembled um so it skipped a lot of
the<00:10:52.320><c> stations</c><00:10:52.640><c> but</c><00:10:52.880><c> what's</c><00:10:53.120><c> cool</c><00:10:53.760><c> is</c><00:10:53.839><c> that</c><00:10:54.000><c> the</c>

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
the stations but what's cool is that the
 

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.630 align:start position:0%
the stations but what's cool is that the
stations<00:10:54.560><c> automatically</c><00:10:55.360><c> know</c><00:10:56.000><c> if</c><00:10:56.160><c> a</c><00:10:56.320><c> step</c>

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
stations automatically know if a step
 

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.069 align:start position:0%
stations automatically know if a step
doesn't<00:10:56.880><c> need</c><00:10:57.040><c> to</c><00:10:57.120><c> be</c><00:10:57.279><c> done</c>

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be done
 

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.310 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be done
automation<00:10:58.720><c> and</c><00:10:58.880><c> they</c><00:10:58.959><c> just</c><00:10:59.120><c> don't</c><00:10:59.279><c> do</c><00:10:59.440><c> it</c><00:10:59.839><c> yep</c>

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
automation and they just don't do it yep
 

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.150 align:start position:0%
automation and they just don't do it yep
so<00:11:00.560><c> it</c><00:11:00.880><c> went</c><00:11:01.120><c> through</c><00:11:01.440><c> and</c><00:11:01.519><c> then</c><00:11:01.760><c> the</c><00:11:01.920><c> next</c>

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
so it went through and then the next
 

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.150 align:start position:0%
so it went through and then the next
stage<00:11:02.560><c> actually</c><00:11:02.800><c> that</c><00:11:02.959><c> we</c><00:11:03.040><c> did</c><00:11:03.279><c> get</c><00:11:03.440><c> to</c><00:11:03.600><c> see</c>

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
stage actually that we did get to see
 

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.949 align:start position:0%
stage actually that we did get to see
was<00:11:04.399><c> it</c><00:11:04.640><c> testing</c><00:11:05.040><c> all</c><00:11:05.279><c> the</c><00:11:05.360><c> switches</c><00:11:06.240><c> so</c><00:11:06.560><c> this</c>

00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
was it testing all the switches so this
 

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:09.670 align:start position:0%
was it testing all the switches so this
giant<00:11:07.440><c> machine</c><00:11:08.240><c> that</c><00:11:08.399><c> was</c><00:11:08.640><c> pre-aligned</c><00:11:09.360><c> for</c>

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
every single one of the keycaps would go
 

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.750 align:start position:0%
every single one of the keycaps would go
down<00:11:12.079><c> and</c><00:11:12.160><c> press</c><00:11:12.640><c> every</c><00:11:12.959><c> single</c><00:11:13.279><c> button</c><00:11:13.519><c> just</c>

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
down and press every single button just
 

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.430 align:start position:0%

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%

quite<00:11:15.839><c> believe</c><00:11:16.240><c> it</c><00:11:16.399><c> when</c><00:11:16.640><c> cherry</c><00:11:16.959><c> told</c><00:11:17.279><c> us</c><00:11:17.440><c> at</c>

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
quite believe it when cherry told us at
 

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.310 align:start position:0%
quite believe it when cherry told us at

that's<00:11:22.160><c> too</c><00:11:22.399><c> much</c><00:11:22.720><c> man</c><00:11:23.200><c> but</c><00:11:23.360><c> they</c><00:11:23.600><c> are</c><00:11:24.000><c> and</c><00:11:24.160><c> we</c>

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's too much man but they are and we
 

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
that's too much man but they are and we
even<00:11:24.560><c> saw</c><00:11:24.800><c> a</c><00:11:24.880><c> keyboard</c><00:11:25.360><c> fail</c><00:11:26.079><c> yeah</c><00:11:26.320><c> yeah</c><00:11:26.480><c> we</c>

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
even saw a keyboard fail yeah yeah we
 

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.710 align:start position:0%
even saw a keyboard fail yeah yeah we
got<00:11:26.720><c> to</c><00:11:26.800><c> see</c><00:11:26.959><c> one</c><00:11:27.200><c> fail</c><00:11:27.519><c> so</c><00:11:28.000><c> the</c><00:11:28.240><c> next</c><00:11:28.480><c> station</c>

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
got to see one fail so the next station
 

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.069 align:start position:0%
got to see one fail so the next station
which<00:11:28.880><c> was</c><00:11:29.040><c> the</c><00:11:29.120><c> laser</c><00:11:29.440><c> engraving</c><00:11:29.839><c> station</c>

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
