00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.400
- This is the brand new
Guinness World Record,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.890
largest ever elephant
toothpaste foam experiment.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.380
In today's video, which is
partially sponsored by LastPass,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.730
I'm gonna walk you through everything

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.770
we have to go through
to get to this point,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.660
as well as some really
cool side discoveries

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.780
we made in our hundreds of
hours of testing along the way.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.610
The main ingredient for
elephant's toothpaste

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.020
is hydrogen peroxide.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.990
It's the same stuff you pour
on a scrape to disinfect it.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.970
The thing is, the bonds
that hold the hydrogen

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.830
and oxygen together are pretty weak.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.990
So if we poured some of this in here,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.760
and just left it for a while,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.100
it would keep releasing
oxygen and eventually,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.480
you'd be left with just water.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.420
However, if you add a catalyst
like potassium iodide,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.549
you could make that slow
process happen almost instantly.

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:41.520
(concoction hisses)

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.740
So that's cool, but we can
make it way more impressive

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.050
if we add one key ingredient, soap.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.440
So if we pour this in and then
do everything else the same,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.390
now when the oxygen is released,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.450
the soap captures it,
creating bubbles and foam.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.070
And then finally, if
you do all that again,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.740
only now you add food
coloring and use a flask

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.880
that tapers like this,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.590
you can focus the expansion of foam

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.745
so it looks maximum awesome.

00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:06.412
(bright music)

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.190
So in order to fill a
pool with this stuff,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.750
I first got together with some friends,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.390
and we spent literally hundreds
of hours for a few weeks

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.010
running experiments to calculate

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.020
the best raw ingredient combinations

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.120
in addition to brainstorming
other cool things

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.990
we might do with it.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.580
And so before we attempted to shatter

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.570
the current world record,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.700
we had an end-of-summer party with my son

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.020
and a bunch of family friends

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.340
where we wanted to share with them

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.650
the coolest side discoveries
from our research.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.840
But first, in true end-of-summer fashion,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.936
we had to knock out some
slip and slide kickball.

00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:38.519
(upbeat music)

00:01:45.907 --> 00:01:49.350
(upbeat music)

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.060
I planned to kick things
off by attacking them

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.950
with an elephant toothpaste gun we made

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.860
as revenge for when a bunch
of these same kids ambushed me

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.940
on a recent beach trip,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.380
and then offered me some cookies

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.630
which were just six massive cockroaches.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.056
And I hate cockroaches.

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:03.606
Shamoo! Get it off me!

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:04.800
However, as part of our testing,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.930
we discover the reaction
is highly exothermic,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.060
which means it generates
heat as a byproduct.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.930
If you watch it infrared,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.400
you'll see the temperature
of the foam right

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.610
after the reaction can reach
almost 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.370
So, because I'm nice, I
shelved my revenge plans

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.680
and just demonstrated what
would've been their fate,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.170
and told them to sit and
watch at a safe distance.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.823
And they listened, sort of.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.880
And so now that we have their
attention, it was showtime.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.974
- [Everyone] Three, two, one!

00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:32.807
- Go!

00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:35.390
(bright music)

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:44.370
(bright music)

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.227
This one is called the melted unicorn.

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:49.810
(bright music)

00:02:57.764 --> 00:03:00.347
(bright music)

00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:08.612
(bright music)

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:12.270
You might recognize Bob
Pflugfelder here, AKA, Science Bob.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.090
He's been on "Jimmy Kimmel
Live" 11 more times than I have,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.180
and I invited him out to join
me for a very specific reason,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.922
which I will address in a bit.

00:03:19.922 --> 00:03:22.505
(bright music)

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:32.420
(bright music)

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.180
And so with the success of
the science show behind us,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.253
it was now time for phase two.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.020
So we are here, standing
in an empty swimming pool,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.000
about to try and break the world record

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.020
for elephant's toothpaste.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.040
You wanna tell the good people

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.050
who owns the current world record, Bob?

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.883
- I do.

00:03:55.883 --> 00:03:56.716
- You wanna tell the good people

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:58.380
who's about to not own
the world record, Bob?

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.958
- Pretty confident, aren't you?

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.410
- (laughs) No, I'm not.
- Mr. Engineer.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.300
- But if everything goes well,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.130
we're hoping to quadruple the amount

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.600
of the current record which you hold.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.490
I'm not sure how much of like the trees

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.154
and neighborhood we're
gonna cover in the process.

00:04:10.154 --> 00:04:10.987
(bell dings)

00:04:10.987 --> 00:04:12.450
Only time will tell,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.430
and chemistry, which I don't understand,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.133
but we'll see what we can come up with.

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:19.716
(bright music)

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:27.120
(bright music)

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.310
We wanted the foam to be
safe to play in afterwards,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.220
so we used ordinary baking
yeast as our catalyst.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.110
We could have bought yeast in big buckets,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.120
but it turned out it
was cheaper to get them

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.380
in one pound bags.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.766
The only downside to that

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:43.590
is then you have to cut open
181 pound bags of yeast,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.637
but that's why we have Science Bob.

00:04:45.637 --> 00:04:46.657
- "Come on out," they said.

00:04:46.657 --> 00:04:48.722
"It'll be fun," they said.

00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:51.389
(bright music)

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.500
- This is an emergency tarp system.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.380
So if we did our math right,
it shouldn't overflow.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.350
In the case that it does,
we have these tarps here

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.730
to contain all of the foam

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.320
from not going everywhere in the yard.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.120
We hope for the best,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.323
plan for the worst.

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:14.246
(bright music)

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.370
We built these three frames for the tarps

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.590
that would contain the
catalyst yeast solution.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.850
So when it was time to fill the pool,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.130
we could just cut the tarps
and it would pour out.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.300
The same way we cut the tarp

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.010
when we added the bigger Orbeez.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.000
- I'm alive!

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.833
- And Kevin.

00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:30.150
(motor whirring)

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.500
It's go time, baby.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.100
We're probably like seven minutes out.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.863
Got a bunch of kids inside
are just rearing to get out.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.859
The challenge here is this water's warm.

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:44.060
We didn't build these
containers big enough,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.780
so this will start rising.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.580
So it's sort of a race against the clock

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.170
before it starts overflowing.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.580
We still have to add the soap,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.643
and then we have to add the food coloring.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:06:00.000
(bright music)

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.603
Oh, this looks terrifying
as I stab this bloody thing.

00:06:04.743 --> 00:06:06.593
I think I'm about to get demonetized.

00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:10.118
(bright music)

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.756
(bright music)

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:16.680
Okay, now we're adding the soap.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.440
- This is what will
actually make the bubbles.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.093
Soap isn't part of the reaction.

00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:23.967
(motors whirring)

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.350
Two more soap buckets.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.350
Oh, as you can see, that
bucket's filling up real quick.

00:06:31.628 --> 00:06:32.850
(bright music)

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.643
So after a few final
touches, we were ready to go.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.210
Three, two, one!

00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:42.990
Now before we cut the tarps,

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.700
I wanna point out I'm not a chemist.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.140
With the physics and engineering problem,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.450
I'm way more comfortable
understanding the parameters

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.760
and getting closer to the
final solution off the bat,

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.760
but chemistry is just little
molecules I can't see.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.530
And it feels a lot like trial and error

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.560
without any guarantee it will
actually scale up predictably.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.200
This was feeling like the
nightmare of the jello pool

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.100
all over again.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.250
To get to this point, we
had ran over 150 tests,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.340
sometimes, at great peril
to that which we hold dear.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.460
And so once again, if
this was a total failure,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.110
it wouldn't be from lack of effort.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.660
Having said all that, here she is.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.097
Two, one, go.

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:22.473
(liquid whooshing)

00:07:32.726 --> 00:07:35.643
(liquid whooshing)

00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:49.211
(children laughing)

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.540
So the good news is we broke the record.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.350
The bad news is we're
kind of overachievers.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.880
Uh oh.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.993
It's coming up.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.634
The great tsunami!

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:08.060
Hey, hold this.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.625
- [Child] Nope, goodbye camera.

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:10.763
- [Mark] Okay, stand back off the tarp.

00:08:11.953 --> 00:08:13.393
- [Child] Goodbye camera!

00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:15.000
- We need to grab 'em, stand back.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.590
Hold this up, Bob.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.423
Okay.

00:08:17.423 --> 00:08:18.256
♪ Whew ♪

00:08:18.256 --> 00:08:20.839
(upbeat music)

00:08:26.108 --> 00:08:27.690
(upbeat music)

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.000
So while we pushed all the
foam back into the pool,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.040
that gave it some time to cool down

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.540
so we could actually touch it.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.793
(upbeat music)

00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:42.129
♪ Whew ♪

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:44.712
(upbeat music)

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.330
The drone was super cool

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.740
because not only did it make the foam

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.600
look like an alien cocoon,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.460
but you could see it travel in infrared

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.980
because it would expose the
much hotter, lower layers

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.753
of foam as it flew around.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.974
What do you guys think?

00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:00.935
Do you think this is gonna float?

00:09:00.935 --> 00:09:02.012
- [Children] No!

00:09:02.012 --> 00:09:03.561
- No? All right, here we go.

00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:06.144
(upbeat music)

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:14.708
(upbeat music)

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.413
(upbeat music)

00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:20.940
After all our tests,

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.800
we perfected the chemistry for this stuff.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.290
So if you wanna make a home
version you can play with,

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.030
check out Science Bob's website.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.252
I'll leave a link in
the video description.

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:31.695
- Oh my gosh! That's so fun!

00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:34.278
(upbeat music)

00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:41.919
(upbeat music)

00:09:43.453 --> 00:09:44.286
(upbeat music)

00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:45.181
♪ Whew ♪

00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:46.014
- All right, Bob.

00:09:46.014 --> 00:09:48.570
Sorry you're looking at an
obsolete piece of material there.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.830
- I had it for over a year.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.090
- You did have it for over a year,

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.080
but all good things must come to an end.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.420
- Say I was mad, but darn,
that was a lot of fun.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.380
- That was a lot of fun.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.090
And I have good news because you

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.830
are still the world record holder.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.840
I'm putting you on there with me, buddy.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.163
Oh yeah, nerd hug.

00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:15.166
(bright music)

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:19.429
(people yelling)

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:24.458
(snowballs striking)
