00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.920
Where does London stop and the terrifying provincial nothingness begin?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.800
Is it the end of the Tube?

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.360
Is it the M25?

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.220
Is it the end of London's postcode area?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.220
If you must know, it's none of these.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.540
London's phone code, postcode and so on were set up at different times by different people

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.840
for different purposes. So where does London officially stop?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.380
The answer is right here, at the edge of the Greater London boundary.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.600
But why is it here and not, say, several metres to the left? Who drew this boundary and when?

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.960
And what difference does it make if you live inside it or not?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.160
And why does this bit stick out here?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.400
♫ ♫ ♫

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.120
Greater London has been this shape and this size since 1965.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.960
But to understand why, you need to look at what London was like in 1964.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.000
Of the eight or so million people who considered themselves Londoners,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.480
as in, they commuted to London, watched London TV and read London newspapers,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.260
fewer than half of them actually technically legally officially lived *IN* London.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.720
The County of London, as it was then known, was drawn up way back in 1889

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.520
in the shape of a rhinoceros to reflect how big London had grown at that time.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.960
But it had long since burst its borders... making the rhinoceros out of date.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.840
This meant that suburbanites were using London's resources

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.360
without paying any taxes to the London County Council, whose job was to run the whole metropolis.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.180
And that wasn't fair.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.920
So a new border was needed that would subsume all of these new suburbs.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.920
The man asked nicely to draw the new border was Sir Edwin Herbert

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.960
- Hello, I'm Sir Edwin Herbert.
- Could you draw a new border for London please?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.880
- Yes.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.640
He assembled a crack team, including the Vice Chancellor of the University of Leeds,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
The President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.080
Professor of Government from the University of Manchester,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.900
and the man who owned the Cadburys chocolate factory in Birmingham.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.680
The commission was notable for not containing anyone with previous involvement with local government in the London area.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.980
Creating an up-to-date border was trickier than it sounds.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.920
London didn't have an obvious edge like many other European cities, it sort of sputtered out gradually.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.620
So drawing a line around it was going to be more of an art than a science.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.160
Never-the-nonetheless, Herbert came up with three scientific tests

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.140
to work out whether a suburb was a suburb or not.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.320
1. Was it an easy commute to central London?

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.220
If a place was within about an hour's reach of the West End by train, it was deemed to pass the first test.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.080
2. Was it independent?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.060
Some places like Watford, Dartford and Slough, despite being close to London,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.860
functioned not as suburbs, but as proper towns in their own right,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.880
with proper shops, businesses, and entertainment, bringing people in from miles around.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.080
3. Did the local population look towards London or away from London for its cultural identity?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.320
This subjective and nebulous question was the hardest to answer and probably just involved asking people.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.520
- What?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.280
Herbert's team spent the best part of the late 50s on an exhaustive tour of boring suburbia.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.280
And when they came back, they handed Sir Edwin Herbert their results...

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.120
- Thank you.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.640
...and this is the border he came up with for the new Greater London.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.840
But that's not the familiar shape of Greater London that we know and love today. So, what happened?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.080
In posh places like Epsom, despite being the epitome of London suburbia,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.960
the locals were worried that if they joined the new Greater London, they'd have to pay more tax.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.900
So they kicked up a stink, pledging allegiance to Surrey.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.120
The same thing was happening at the other end, in posh Chigwell in Essex,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.420
and posh Knockholt in Kent.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.100
The wealthy stink-up-kickers, as usual, got what they wanted.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.280
So the border had to be redrawn in a totally illogical way that arbitrarily split the suburbs in two.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.760
The only place that didn't seem to mind being in Greater London was Chessington World of Adventures.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.280
And that's how they settled on this final and now familiar shape.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.520
The London County Council would be abolished, and replaced by the Greater London Council.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.260
London was also divided into 32 new boroughs. But that's a story for another time.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.420
On the 1st of April 1965, four and a half million people woke up as Londoners for the first time

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.180
and this caused some confusion.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.900
Take, for example, Romford. If you were a Romford resident, your council changed but your address didn't.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.500
It still said "Essex" on your envelopes. So were you still in Essex or not?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.420
Technically, the Home Counties around the outside of London all got smaller in 1965.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.560
Surrey lost a massive chunk, which bizarrely included Surrey County Hall in Kingston

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.340
which, even more bizarrely, continues to run Surrey to this day despite not being in it.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.140
- Oi! Pay your council tax!
- Why don't you come over here and make me?

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.620
But one county had the worst luck of them all.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.000
Poor old Middlesex, already lumbered with a funny name, was gobbled up almost entirely by Greater London

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.860
and the remaining bits were ceded to neighbouring Surrey and Hertfordshire.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.180
As a result, since 1965, Middlesex is no longer a thing. And the name lives on only on envelopes and in cricket.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.080
This is what gives Romford residents an identity crisis.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.480
Ceremonially, historically, in their accents, and perhaps in their souls, they're Essex boys and girls,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.300
but legally, politically, officially, they're Londoners, whether they like it or not.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.300
So why does this matter? What are the benefits of living in Greater London today?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.540
And why might you be hacked off if you live just outside the border?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.780
One big factor is transport.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.100
On London buses, you can pay by contactless, and take advantage of the 2-for-1 Hopper Fare.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.560
Whereas buses in the Home Counties are patchy and much more expensive.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.800
And it's not just buses that are better.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.180
When I turned 60, I got a 60+ Oyster card, which means I can travel anywhere in London for free.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.320
Whereas my friend Jill who lives over the border in Hertfordshire has to pay thousands for a season ticket.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.480
More important than all of this is democracy. If you live inside the Greater London boundary

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.700
you get to take part in elections for the London Assembly and the Mayor of London.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.520
Think this doesn't matter? Look at the Metropolitan line.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.200
Fast trains to Amersham were cancelled by Boris Johnson in 2012

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.040
And the planned extension to Watford Junction was cancelled by Sadiq Khan in 2016.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.420
Would these things have happened if the locals had a chance to vote the mayor out?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.520
Does anything need to be done about this?

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.920
After all, the border of what counts as London has changed time and time again since the Romans.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.000
So now, 50-something years since Greater London was invented, is it time to look at those borders again?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.920
London may have stopped physically sprawling outwards when the Green Belt was introduced

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.540
in the 30s, but the capital's influence is still very expanding indeed.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.080
People are now commuting into London from further than ever before as they seek cheaper housing.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.380
Shouldn't these people have a say in how the city they depend on is run?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.120
And then there's the six airports, only two of which are in Greater London. Is it about time that changed?

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.420
In the end, it's not really important.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.200
In a world where borders are worryingly starting to matter more than ever before,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.040
this one that we've been discussing is thankfully quite a benign one.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.160
It's not as if Greater London is a city state that you need a passport to get into...

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.760
yet.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.600
So for now, depending on how you live, work, shop and feel,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.400
the line where London stops and the outside world begins is entirely up to you.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.320
And no matter where the official boundary is officially drawn,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.880
there will always be people who feel like they're on the wrong side.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.660
Oh boy, I can't wait to try out my new Problem Solver 3000.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.420
